Hed felt momentary relief that he wasnt already stuck behind bars .	Walking away from victors .	after
My heartbeat is thudding in my eardrums .	I reach for the doorknob .	as
Me to be paranoid .	It 's okay . '' .	so
I washed my face slowly getting the bar grime .	Headed back to my room .	and
She followed his movements .	There was a strange sheen gathering in her eyes , as if she were slipping .	but
Perhaps there was no threat at all .	It had been merely a hedgehog or hare that bounded through the foliage .	and
This surely marked the dome .	Protecting something of great importance .	as
Hed again guided me .	I knew there was more i needed to write , a fact i needed to fully embrace .	but
She lost control of her limbs .	Reeled back but , with effort , she remained standing only to see the woman had grabbed hold of something and was coming her way .	and
I saw him in the stands .	Mom and kaylin did .	but
She pulled back , her eyes searching mine .	Then she reclaimed the distance , and , damn , the kiss was half innocent , half desperate , and wholly perfect .	and
She moaned and her hands tunneled into his hair .	Sam took her breast into his mouth .	when
She put her hands in front of her face .	Cried as if her heart would break .	and
One half was dedicated to light , space , and darkspace based technologies .	The other half focused on genetic manipulation and biological weapon creation .	while
First he looked at me .	I could tell he liked what he saw .	and
He 'd kissed her until she forgot everything .	She 'd started to argue .	when
How to wrestle sin right to the ground .	Grind its ugly face into the dirt .	and
I would never take him back , but my head is so damned confused .	I miss what we had .	because
Maybelle and wanda saw you .	You vaulted over the bar to get to me .	when
Anyone who happened to open the book would find them and i kept them because i needed to .	Would know what i had done .	but
I 'm never scared .	I 'm scared for jace .	but
She claimed to be a graduate student at the national university .	That told me little .	but
She promised she would let me sleep during the days .	She would not leave the hotel room on her own .	and
He thought some of them were bad things i thought most of them were n't . .	He was a lot of things , and .	but
The call came from inside the hotel .	If it came from outside , it would have registered on her monitor .	because
He had actually opened the top drawer of my bureau .	I said , `` no , no .	before
Her face down in her hands .	Her father could see and let the tears flow .	before
He waited beside her .	She called the office and explained the situation .	while
I started to scratch behind her ears .	I had a hold on her .	when
He was rushed , and i let it go .	His grip was a bit too firm for a guide dog .	but
Can you bring them to fortnum 's ? '' .	You talk to tex .	when
He caught a glimpse of the woman , tossing salt .	Even he saw jake fling out his arm .	as
Soon he will be the # 1 mercenary in the city .	He keeps his head in it .	if
There was always a knife ready for the helpless throat , or a sandaled foot eager to crush the prostrate skull .	A woman or man went down under the stamping feet .	when
I dared open my eyes .	I felt him pull away from me and settle my feet on what felt like hardwood flooring .	when
His search was unavailing of the fate of elured and elurin no tale tells .	Of this maedhros indeed repented , and sought for them long in the woods of doriath ; but .	and
Imrm makes one last great leap onto the ledge in a terrifying display of physical strength and agility .	Shooting up from a nearby peak .	and
Another reaper , darius , had stepped in and all .	Revealed himself to this mortal .	but
But ... it rubs off .	I brush the skin .	as
She stared at the statue .	Expecting it to come to life .	as
`` look , we can stand out here and you 're getting in this truck . '' .	Argue about it for the next ten minutes .	but
`` let 's go mingle , '' she suggested .	Pesh also turned down any dessert .	when
He tried to put them .	His senses reported the soft movement of the guards and the flow of water beneath his chamber .	while
Water filled the gullies .	Smoothed the cracked baked clay .	and
Then so be it .	Our foundations are built on gunpowder .	if
Get them used to you giving orders .	Make those orders good ones .	but
There was an alarmed cry , a faint crash .	He struck the tree .	as
Burying the first ninjas blade in the wooden container .	Flinging both attackers away from him .	and
So he was alert .	She turned to run and caught her easily before she made her escape .	when
The officer is of medium height .	Stands with his shoulders hunched .	and
Even in the darkness .	He waited for me to put my stunned brain back together and pick up my own weapon .	as
Ransom had not yet grasped it with his muscles and nerves .	He had now grasped with his brain what was happening .	although
Blood was all over his body .	Then the other vampire hit him .	and
But this takes the words from her mouth .	Casts them aside to be ignored .	and
He trusted sam like a brother .	He had to protect tasha in case the situation blew up in their faces .	but
It seemed to me that i had been a third wheel the entire weekend , not privy to some of the behind-the-scenes machinations that pharrah and walter were always retiring to work on .	Even i had been invited first on the trip .	though
We make hunger games history .	Peeta and i each pull a twelve .	when
Nynia laughed from above him .	She gently rode him .	as
I brought this up for you . '' .	Since you 're dumping me , i 'll drink it myself .	but
Just she conjured one of her sweet balls of fire .	Threw it at the incubus .	and
He leaned over the desk toward her , `` .	Should you find her first , you will save her for me .	and
Cheryl is a civilian .	She gave birth to a brother 's son .	but
I left my room .	Went downstairs , where daphne was waiting with logan and carson .	and
A smile traces his lips .	He reaches in his pocket .	when
Knocking the sword and shield out of jays hand .	Sweeping him off his feet .	and
All right , '' she answered , across the battered kitchen table .	Slid into the chair opposite .	and
Landing next to the blue loralite stone .	The chests skid across the floor .	as
We never met in person .	Even we stayed in contact for the last five years .	though
Jeremy stayed at his side and daniel heard him .	Continued with his banter .	but
After i 'd hashed the issue over with myself , i decided i had .	I further decided i had to have a day .	and
`` your messages , miss clarke , '' lucah said .	I walked back to my office .	as
To - '' his fingers tensed .	His face came to within an inch of mine .	and
Liao held open the hatch .	Rowe clambered through and then she set it down with a dull clank .	as
I ached to be back in the sunshine where it was warm and demon-free .	All i had to do to accomplish that was to run faster .	and
To go back into the house .	A dirty blue car pulled in front of the garage and parked .	when
She had turned her will over to meredith .	I sensed her discomfort .	but
Everybody will know where we are .	I withdraw it or write a check .	if
Showing up late was one thing .	Stealing would certainly be grounds for dismissal .	but
To remind herself of that from time to time .	Especially cases involved children .	when
Who comes in contact with them .	Who may have known about my disappearance .	and
She suddenly heard the young woman moaning .	She poured warm hagar soup into a wooden bowl .	as
Tylers family is safe .	They were out of town when this thing happened .	because
Her body was on fire .	This was different , this would change things .	but
But , he gave no hint .	He found the moment awkward .	if
Then it was hard to have much of an appetite .	She was so damn stuck .	when
Lucy felt there was a tune in it .	She could not catch the tune any more than she had been able to catch the words when the trees had so nearly talked to her the night before .	but
He wanted to test the limits and made another spell .	He remembered the name for the use of applied magic , and this time he wasnt surprised to see a reflection appear in thin air .	as
I looked around in absolute amazement .	Images came into view .	as
Then they went back and , and they took it out on other people .	Took it out on their secretaries or traffic wardens or whatever .	and
But , she tried to shift away from him .	His mouth moved lower .	when
Claire stood at the base of the steps .	Conjured out of his daydreams .	if
Ben usually joined these initial meetings , dr. rudolph told her last friday .	When he told her that ben would not be .	also
Cary was my closest friend .	He always gave it to me straight , even when i desperately wanted sugarcoating .	because
That so often did .	He was at busy and crowded events .	when
The golden eagles easily beat syracuse in the opening round , the fifth time this year he had been over 30 .	Matthew scored 31 points .	as
He had scribbled on a piece of paper .	He spoke to april and i .	before
She saw him approaching her .	She fastened her seatbelt for landing .	as
Andra touched his arm in an effort to soothe him .	Succeeded only in making him flinch .	but
I didnt know how this would help get us over into pact .	I trusted he knew what he was doing .	but
Most of them snapped out of it once they had more distance from abe .	Some were really committed to this thing .	but
You have to live .	You want the nightmares to go .	if
He looked , but instead he simply said , your shifts over .	He wanted to say something cutting .	though
Bringing in serena tennyson .	Your original time frame runs out .	before
Most of them were false-i .	Was alive after all .	still
Carl had agreed to attend the thanksgiving day parade with her .	They 'd barely arrived and already he was anxious to leave .	but
His egg had been treated with the greatest of care .	That had not availed anything : it had hatched out caesar , a most disagreeable dragon , who had taken as captain none other than the paltry jeremy rankin .	but
I still take meds .	Have tweaked them a bit and am slowly weaning off one of them .	but
I felt his lips curve against the side of my neck .	Jack let out a high-pitched laugh at something jase 's father had said in the kitchen .	when
I wrote the above .	Writing the first three stories .	after
She felt , pulling her , tugging her in every direction .	Her entire being was sucked into a vacuum .	if
They send someone to check it out .	I have no choice except to own up to who i really am .	because
When tom had been a kid , the old river road had been in daily use .	Was then connected to one of the bridges .	and

So her mother 's , trevor nearly lost his breath .	He looked into green eyes .	as
He gasped swallowed because the liquid kept coming .	Hot liquid scalded his tongue , but .	and
She was pretty far from the light at the entrance , which made it difficult to see .	She was eventually rewarded for her efforts when she recognized her own childish writing on a large box tucked into the corner .	but
Akasha crackled over my right arm .	I threw my hand out .	as
He once again did .	Planted a soft kiss on it .	and
We had to straighten up and get ready to go .	It was time to go meet his little friend greystoke at the park for our playdate .	because
He felt weightless and .	He arrived only to find that a building for tourists had been built there with a cafe and souvenir shop .	when
It had caused a devastating explosion that would be fine with her .	Elayne had tried it .	when
Justin scooped the ore off the pan .	Laid it on the desk .	and
To be past sunset .	He went out to meet people .	before

The hull was creaking , the deck moving .	Pretty was squealing in distress .	and
Had already been large .	Now , he appeared more .	but
Then it was jacksons turn to cross .	He paused a moment , looking down into the chasm that had opened at his feet .	but
The street name was different .	Some of the houses seemed familiar .	but
I admit his expression gave me a purely adrenal thrill , like if i offered him the slightest encouragement , he 'd back me up against the wall .	Do me hard with my elegant gown around my waist .	and
Apparently he had been a waiter at the last one at some point in time .	Was no longer employed .	but
They had their own personal demons .	None of them were the touchy-feely types looking to have dr. phil crawl up their ass with a flashlight .	though
I left the office .	They had a chance to escape .	before
But , he and grady would have words .	Cauthon survived the battle downriver .	if

He retracted his wings .	Without saying a word , he had her flying through nether-space .	and
She signed , amy want go home .	Elliot told her that they had no real bananas .	when
Kritanu turned from his nephew .	Looked up at max .	and
Heretofore handed over ten dollars for them .	Spent an evening wearing down the left heel enough to be noticeable .	and
Obviously well fed partial to ale , but .	Captain rob saw in him a strength of character and a sense of pride , that kidd had obviously dented .	and
How can i shoot a battle scene .	I feel crushed into dust .	when
They barely got their orders .	The waiter showed up .	before
It was starting to get dark .	She knew exactly what kinds of creatures came out once the darkness trickled across the sky .	and
