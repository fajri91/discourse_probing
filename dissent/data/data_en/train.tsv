I smiled weakly through the cloud of dust .	Grabbed the hand he offered .	and
Is it ? '' .	It 's not as nice as that california weather .	though
Somehow my shirt ended up on the floor .	I should 've felt embarrassed .	and
I think he had started to put his arm around me , maybe to keep me warm .	He backed off at the last second .	but
Who opened the gates .	Let the foe march through .	and
He tried to put his arms around his mother then , as he had when he was a child for he was alone on the path .	He might as well have been trying to hold mist .	although
Sean breathes me in .	Taking his hands and pushing my knees farther .	before
Ripped the shield off his right arm .	Almost burst the straps that bound his golden hand to his stump .	and
More splashing followed , so he squeezed his eyes shut .	He really , really , really wanted to turn around to see how many bubbles were left .	because
Jack was about to look around again for help .	He heard footsteps behind him .	when
Sir richard leases these fields to the martins .	They dont mind if we pass .	but
You 're inclined to agree with the governor , sir .	Radio contact sticks in my throat .	but
The tent material violently jumps up and down like scary ghosts .	The nbots record the silly event .	as
And i feel , i 'm abandoning her .	I 'm with you .	when
He was bending down .	He could cross his legs over each other hiding his man junk .	so
It was there that i told her my plans .	Eating in a largely empty restaurant .	while
She used to love to snuggle into him when they rode in a carriage .	He were a great bear rug .	as
I enter the cold bedroom .	Dressing inside the sleeping bag .	after
As a child i had anger issues .	Would growl when mad .	and
She was already in college .	My dad 's accident happened .	when
The two eldest sons took over the sundry shop .	The old man died .	when
Whitney turned to clayton , intending to introduce nicki to him .	Evidently they had already met .	but
The left boot pinches my heel , and it hurts .	I walk around the deck .	as
I felt a sharp , sudden , stabbing pain in my head .	A pair of fingers were digging into my skull .	as
I 'm afraid not . '' .	I 'll be right over .	but
St cloud poured another half glass of whisky .	Slid the bottle out of the grey goons reach .	then
When , a few months after argyles fourteenth birthday , he informed us hed be leaving .	It came as quite a shock .	so
Elections would be won and lost , administrations changed .	The army of campaign workers who looked to daniel coughlin for direction would be secure in their jobs .	but
Though it 's doubtful the geishas were fully fluent , and he could just hop across the table , chloroform me , drag me out and he 'd take care of it .	Just telling 'em it was a bad reaction to shellfish .	while
She had done everything she could to protect her .	Somehow it hadnt been .	but
Zooming in and out .	They tried to capture each bit of the scene .	as
To listen to a lot of indie bands and alternative rock .	I was in college .	when
Svana smiled , but it was too large .	She adjusted the crown .	as
So i 'll tag you .	I have everything ready to go over .	when
The cartel came next in line .	Howard had a hard time hating a faceless mass , which is what the cartel represented .	but
His scanning of the chambers ahead picked up movement .	Nothing registered as a life form .	although
It became obvious to reggie that mark knew where the body was allegedly buried , and she skillfully and fearfully danced around this information .	The secret and confidential conversation unfolded .	as
Her wide open eyes told me she knew death was .	I found more surprise than despair .	but
It was nearly $ 300 .	Searching through the duffle bag pockets she found the wad of cash and her eyes went wide .	after
I think both of us are professional enough to put our differences .	It comes to work .	when
Mike stood there at the lobby doors watching jim .	He walked out to his pickup to leave .	as
Abalanor prompted him with a slight motion of one hand .	It no longer appeared that he was even to say anything .	when
That safely guard from outside powers .	As he is the new owner of the room , only ethan could retrieve the items .	and
Flinging her arms in the air .	Muttering styric words she should not have known existed .	and
Frantically i look around for an escape .	He is blocking my only exit .	but
He meant to ask her to watch over boy23 for him .	Silk wouldnt get why .	but
They all considered this .	Nick took out his butane match and burned the scrap of paper .	as
He lifted his gaze to hers , intent on pushing the decision he wanted .	There was only one small delicacy left untouched .	when
And vito would torture his grandmother . '' .	He felt it served a purpose .	if
I stared at him in confusion .	He lifted me up and placed me on the couch next to him .	as
She really should have called him .	She realized she would be home much later than usual .	when
He murmured the words .	He leaned in closer to me .	as
Jamie had never been reckless .	He had been a warrior and a soldier most of his life .	but
The car tires bump the curb .	I pull up to his house .	as
Pilgrims and other priests were moving closer .	The threat of the three men was enough to keep them at a safe distance .	but
Nobody is paying attention .	He grabs me by the elbow and pulls me into an empty office .	but
My physical body slowing down .	The world is moving past me .	as
The seconds grew lankier , watching the body on the ground .	They waited in silence .	as
The cloud continued to darken , and i held onto the slats of the balcony railing .	Seth pulled on my arm .	but
Something strange was happening .	I did not like it .	and
He is a fine beast .	Will serve you faithfully for years to come .	and
She would do it , if she wanted to .	She did still have some morality to her and only killed those that she felt deserved the death .	although
Whitney had obviously discovered it .	Either bought it or persuaded his backers to allow him to use it for his experiments .	and
I would go after her myself .	She 's impossible to track .	but
He had raw scratches down his cheeks .	Bled from his nose and lip .	and
Why would you take this contract .	You knew youd why wouldnt i .	if
Dawkins fetched a handful of other relics off the altar .	Returned with them resting on the open grimoire in his hands .	and
I suddenly want to punch ridge .	I know he has nothing to do with it .	but
Even buy me dinner .	She fucked me with her eyes .	before
He was confused at first .	He felt her resistance .	when
He closed his eyes .	Murmured , its only a text book .	and
Sometimes we dispensed with caution and simply killed them .	Particularly time was of the essence .	when
He kissed my neck .	Chuckling , then let me go and tugged his jeans .	still
She was still sore tired and .	When lyrell noticed , she helped adri bind her ribs .	and
The big man had gone down fighting .	He 'd been no match at all .	but
Sergeant , it might be a good idea , whispered catherine .	We had a break .	if
Youll also find robbie stuffed in the trunk .	You find the car .	when
Theres no use paying you anything .	These pictures have gotten around .	if
The creature raised a leg .	Swatted at her but she just twirled .	and
Cursed at her under my breath .	I watched her sleep this time , thoughdon .	as
How much i hate it .	He goes ahead to `` scout .	when
If i pushed beyond the barrier in your mind , i would be able to read your thoughts as lifemates do with one another .	I am trying to be considerate and wait until you wish to share your thoughts with me .	but
Their last beer runs .	Partying down in newport .	after
The structure is intact , the fire damage appears contained to downstairs .	Everything is going to be water-logged from the fire hoses .	but
Being a thief works best .	You dont get caught .	if
There was a very serious and deep thinker under it all .	Thomas had a light and carefree outer shell .	while
Mainly he never lost control .	Sometimes i forgot that he was far from perfect or saintly .	but
Aside from that , however , greydawn castle looked .	Inviting as it could be made to look .	as
He picked a crazy combination of flavours that i thought was odd .	He laughed it off saying i didnt know what i was missing and that there was no wrong choice when it came to mingling frozen yogurt .	but
All the blood had drained from the veins .	My muscles refused to cooperate .	and
He particularly likes sitting on the ironing-board .	The table is also acceptable .	but
Men in amanheld must have a devil of a time .	All the women blush as soon as you look at them .	if
It was this potion of feelings that had me wanting to rip the shirt from his body , along with whatever else stood between us .	At the same time , i wanted to enjoy the taste of anticipation , the desire gently fanning the flame .	but
They rode directly into a large group of murgos carrying torches .	They crossed the first ridge .	as
I should have consulted you .	I gave them my response .	before
That had been unleashed online .	He had posted my video demanding the ransom .	after
They had just crossed the street .	The door to the eldridge sisters ' shop swung open and katherine stepped .	when
I felt new words in my mind - lissa 's .	I could actually do anything .	before
None of this would 've happened .	We had found her .	if
Qezza was still crying .	Jezhene had appeared to comfort her .	but
Suddenly , the shimmering light disappeared .	I could see what was in my hands .	and
He stroked his hand down her body .	He gently pressed his fingers to her clit .	while
She yelled the last part .	She flung open the door .	as
Now being carried through her front door .	Some distant relative was showing it off to her .	if
With a silent nod , gaultier 's eyes followed his brother .	He turned and left the ship .	as
Her mouth dropped open .	Her entire posture relaxed .	as
They tried to stop him .	He had a preternatural strength .	but
Aramei tries to crawl away on her backside and hands .	Viktor walks over and kneels beside her , rendering her immobile .	but
His blue eyes narrowed .	His hands tightened around the plate and the glass .	and
Dimovna 's head swung around on a swivel .	More and more youths added their opinions .	as
Where reconciliation across the vast void was possible .	Tonight all was silent for a dark mist hung over both worlds as they knew something was coming .	but
They will be placed in this containment building with their families for as long as it is necessary .	Anybody is caught giving out information , or breaking any important codes of conduct .	if
She entered another room .	Three men lay stretched out on beds , needles in the arms and blood being drained from their bodies .	and
He ground his teeth .	His morning erection went more rigid than was normal .	when
It was a simple act , innocent .	It churned up the acid in my stomach in one hot bite .	but
She was doing 40 miles per hour .	She took the curve of the entrance ramp .	as
Something had signaled that their scene was concluded .	Even she kissed him .	before
`` be easier . '' .	You let me kill him .	if
Mocking satisfaction on his face .	He had known all along she would fall in with his plan .	though
Now it detected the hat .	It entered the great hall .	as
I opened my mouth to scream .	He moved quick , leaning forward and grabbing a handful of shirt to jerk me headlong through the window .	but
The work was aerobic , blood was pumped through the body , and oxygen burned .	They were climbing up .	while
He was well versed in wyrdmarks .	He 'd never seen one like hers .	but
Luci , girl - '' sam started on a growl .	I turned , tiptoeing away and then not knowing where i was going .	but
His brows snapped up .	He felt the faint pull from the torn skin on his forehead .	and
He glanced up at his bedroom window .	They passed and noticed that today at least he 'd had the good sense to leave it open .	as
Mam ' was shocked out of her inner horror .	Returned to the frightening present by a white man shoving his face right against hers and screaming some mindless babble in an angry , insane voice .	and
It 's simpler than the others you 've tried on .	I think it 'll look lovely on you .	but
You still have to animate it .	You finish gluing it .	when
Cutting through houses and streets .	We were about four blocks from the bungalow .	when
They confiscated the farm .	I refused to pay .	when
The pipes ran dry .	The pumps at the water towers functioned no more .	and
If it came to that , he would attack them .	He stood by and let them kill his mother and his friend .	before
Desire was hot in his eyes .	A faint smile crossed my mouth as i wondered if i 'd find out if he 'd taken al up on that circumcision curse .	and
Reichen stood up and offered her his hand .	She closed the slim device .	as
You will know , that you are not the one who did anything wrong .	It is all done .	when
Then changed into a white skirt and a frilly pink silk blouse .	She brushed her hair .	as
`` and you know those three boys ? '' .	You all live at the same boys ' home .	because
Sticking his head back into the room he looked at her .	He was choosing his words .	though
Then he dropped his head .	Kissed the smile away from her face .	and
I reminded myself that there was a good chance slapping the water at this velocity would still lead to me snapping my neck and dying .	A slim chance was better than no chance .	but
We should have seen them from the chariot . '' .	Even they 'd walked .	if
He crawled back from the ledge .	Wrapped his arms tightly around his knees .	and
A thing about last night .	I blew out my candles .	after
The lawyer told us .	We pled guilty that he 'd be sentenced to twelve years but only do six .	when
He waved merrily vanished .	Ripped the unmaking out of the ground in a single mighty pull .	and
What we might have been .	Circumstances had been different .	if
Her arms gripped the back of my neck .	My arms grasped her around her naked waist .	while
Reading pieces from greydawns collection .	He was not tutoring its countess or its heir .	when
That six months of lessons hardly sufficed .	The malcontents had centuries of experience , mikhail tilted his head to look around her .	when
Navigating around lines of people and roped off sections .	He 'd long ago memorized where the clogged trouble spots were .	though
My arm had fur .	My hand had claws , and michelle 's blood squirting under her skin through her jugular tickled my fingers .	and
Cootie girl and me left unpaired .	That there was only nazi boy .	after
Who stuffs a fistful of sweets in his mouth .	Passing the bag to a giggling prim .	before
I placed the phone back in its cradle .	Just max and jason returned to the living room .	as
Having my rear in the air not only distracted the menfolk .	Afforded me an excellent look .	but
He took a few more seconds .	He felt ready to answer .	before
He thought about what mandy , the waitress , had said to him a couple of hours .	Joey drove his rental car through the darkness toward sedona .	as
He must have had the means of getting in himself .	He had declined the receptionists help .	if
He couldnt fit all the way in .	Squirming a little he was able to get his front half in far enough to reach back and attach the cardboard to the far edge , where it hung down like a flap .	but
Archie picked something shiny off the table .	Tossed it to andy .	and
I wanted to complain a bit .	Then he swept me into his arms and treated me to a nice , relaxing , soapy shower .	but
Advancing the two runners on a sacrifice , evan leaned over , intending to ask celia exactly what he was missing out on , but she put her hand on his arm and squeezed .	The batter flied out to center field .	after
Who tend to go about barefooted .	They 're not in public .	when
Holding onto jazz , i kick his legs out from under him .	I turn us to the side , ending with us falling into the cushions of the sofa with me mostly on top of him .	while
They were talking to the real santa claus not just some seasonal department store employee .	How far their child had traveled or .	and
She would have lived .	She had stayed put .	if
We 're just friends , sundance .	You have no problem with me slow dancing with another guy .	but
Beth felt the warmth in the seats .	She fastened her seat belt .	as
They were located in the far north .	He wanted to make sure he had plenty of time to complete his mission and get back before the dance was .	and
Eshe glanced around their surroundings .	They waited for the door to be answered .	as
Cloud cover was low and thick .	It held the rain to nothing more than occasional splattering drops , ten whole seconds between each of them , maybe six in every minute .	but
I want to text kate .	She 'll know there are a bunch of nuts at the end of the driveway .	so
He was a general .	When he was still a redcoat .	and
She got caught up in a couple of raids on parties when she lived in pittsburgh .	She was never a prostitute .	but
He met up with simpson outside the hotel .	Took a cab to wentworths gun shop .	and
It made her shield powers stronger .	She used a dirty needle at 14 , infecting herself with hiv .	when
I winked back ( mine probably not lascivious ) and drove carefully swiftly , to lavender house .	Moved quickly back to my car .	but
He has to know .	He got out of the limo .	when
The citizens of boston will not stand .	Their rights are being abridged by criminal elements .	while
I dont want to do this interview .	If youre not going to let me do the interview , i would still be pushing through with this story .	but
He was shocked by how much he had come to love her , and how badly he wanted her to love him .	He watched billie phone in their order .	as
No one would know .	You had a little nip of liquid courage .	if
His back had stiffened as he turned around to see who it was .	Someone cleared her throat behind him .	when
My last relationship had been with someone i .	I was just being picky .	if
Off the screen he is as much a goofball .	He is on it .	as
The fight was short .	Chickasaw warriors gained entrance to the walls .	when
His movements were performed in the careful and precise manner of the very old .	There was nothing of the feebleness you might expect in a man of ninety-one winters , especially one from whom life had exacted .	but
To savor the shock and dismay on the faces of miss laroux and her companions .	They register my sudden reappearance .	as
The intense heat should have burnt their bodies at this distance .	The heat appeared to be tolerable for them .	but
Cold and light spilled over us , and i moaned .	Ivy pulled away from me .	when
I just - '' she started .	Was cut off with a growled , clipped , very , very angry , `` what the f**k ? '' .	but
She was wrapped in his arms , and his lips were pressed sweetly down on hers .	He quite understood how it happened .	before
Audrey introduced me to the band .	Then , i went to my study group .	and
I walked over to the rock .	Laid my hands on it .	and
They were at least quick in reloading .	Donnell and dunne still had some difficulty in finding the target .	if
He leaned over and recited his miranda rights to him .	Even he didnt think people like minden should have any rights .	though
She tried to stand up .	The muscles in her legs rebelled and she only ended up sinking to the ground .	but
Jerome had always been very tight-lipped about where he lived .	I suspected it was only carter 's intervention that allowed us to even remain .	and
Ayden loved him and rome had developed an odd fondness for the southern charmer .	So even he was slippery and slick .	though
Elizabeth said into the phone , `` are you still engaged to that newspaper publisher ? '' .	The social amenities had been disposed of .	when
He 'd returned with champagne and strawberries-and joined her .	Just she 'd sunk into the full tub .	as
The robot cocked its head to one side .	Then raised its fists .	and
They seem to be happy for us to find our own way .	I think they are worried about us being .	although
I dont need his agreement , and i am certainly not sharing my prize .	I want them released .	if
Tears streamed down my face .	I finally broke down .	as
The weapon slid from his grasp , even as he swayed back and forth , as though he might faint .	Clattered to the floor .	and
Then all of us should .	One of us goes .	if
I didnt know how eva managed to do it .	She always knew the best things to say to add to my irritation , obviously shed spent too much time with my mother .	but
Not gone lighter than when i pulled up and .	Found her standing on the edge of the bridge .	but
Clint 's strength returned a bit .	He munched on beef jerky .	as
He smiled and kissed me on the forehead .	Walking over the towels and turning on the shower .	before
They never have . '' .	I 'm not sure whether that 's been a mercy or a cruelty .	and
She carefully pulled him into a tight hug , avoiding wetting her bandages .	Ryker pulled himself from the pool .	as
He forced his face through the mothers chest , but didnt get a reaction .	Tried to scare the girl .	and
Was flushed and sweaty .	He stumbled into a quick bow and scrambled down the stairs .	as
It was about the most painful way to do it .	The blood had caked to the torn mesh and my skin , but also the only modest way .	as
Stay in your seats .	We pull up to the gate .	when
He 'd completely come undone .	He caught my face in my orgasm on a hundred different mirrors .	when
Moving in together in a month .	I had signed a lease on a nice place near downtown just last week .	and
The wardens were investigating suspicious deaths .	It was impossible for them to catch everyone .	but
Exactly where i left it .	Even everything is , i can tell a stranger invaded my privacy .	though
To burn inside her shoes .	They rubbed against the leather .	as
It has been a long time .	I think i could find it .	but
They accelerated to 100kph ( 60mph ) and the police cars dropped .	They merged north onto i-110 .	as
I suddenly get nervous wondering if it 's going to hurt .	I lie on the table .	as
I climbed out of the driver 's seat , going around to the front of the hood where sam and kimber joined me .	We all stood there , measuring each other up , preparing for some kind of battle .	and
Eventually , agent bradley and seth arrived .	Came in the back door in an attempt to avoid the media .	but
Carl was a good two decades older than michael .	The younger man had actually spent a handful of years serving on the force in cardiff .	but
To be recognized by someone from school .	Wanting to not be seen running with aglionby boys .	and
Anything nice to you .	I were the one .	if
There is the bonfire glade in front of us ( or i hope so ) ! ' .	The path to it seems to have moved .	but
Now , you 've got to be a hero .	Your life is on the line .	when
The security and armies of clan michelab lost their leadership and became so much rabble .	Organized resistance fell with guns .	also
The locale may have changed .	Apparently her role was still the same .	but
Thatd be a start .	You wouldnt believe it .	but
She turned back to face me .	She stepped backward until her legs touched the bed .	as
Not that hed had too much opportunity .	Hed first arrived the training being probably the toughest of any military unit in the world .	when
Alex woke up asked with a foggy look , what just happened .	Propped herself up on her elbows .	and
We could hear something coming toward us .	We ran through the dark as fast as we could .	and
The guy you want to see comes in .	You 'll find him at the upham 's corner place most other nights .	but
All right , thats more like it .	You say so all right , thanks a million tell that brother of yours i said fuck you .	if
That 's called a reality wave .	It 's commonly used in mass demolition .	and
If one passed through a room , conversation would falter .	People would look momentarily distressed , as if all were having gas pains at the same time .	and
The good thing about everyone 's post-disaster catatonia was that nobody wanted to be intrusive-they 'd express concern or issue an invitation . '' .	They were more than understanding if you said , `` i just want to be .	but
Normally myron , the image-conscious entrepreneur , would comment on this .	Now did not seem an appropriate ( or safe ) time .	but
Never was a follower of doomba .	I am not involved yet i know that i should help you all .	still
His chest was covered with gashes and dried blood .	Even though he was visibly in pain , he managed to stay upright , leaning against juliet for support .	but
Lon knew , magx knew , darlm knew ... was what m-o-o-o-n dreaming was all about ... wherein all in the kin became her .	Frak came to learn that she-her .	and
Well , some of it was joel .	The part that was me was definitely me .	but
Maybe he 'd interfered with something he should 've left .	He 'd done it to protect her .	but
`` surviving being the operative word there , '' owen said under his breath .	It was apparently still loud enough to make dad roll his eyes .	though
Devil sucked her bottom lip into his mouth .	Plunging his tongue inside .	before
The frenchman was bleeding .	Nothing about his wound appeared to be serious .	but
His tongue danced with hers .	His hands moved down her body .	as
The list is endless and the vampire epidemic has never really been a confirmed threat in this country until recently . '' .	Spans hundreds of decades .	but
What i 'm asking .	He could choose to be an ass and feign incomprehension .	although
Elsewhere around the reception area , various distinguished ace visitors had transmuted a chrome ashtray into some kind of weird purple glass , twisted steel bars into new and fanciful shapes .	Constructed a perpetual-motion machine that had been whirring happily away for four years .	and
They were not found or killed .	The previous world fell even more quickly than ours .	because
Falon 's delicate neck snapped , the life abandoning her body .	It crumpled uselessly , empty , souless to the floor .	as
Bond went outside and ate his bean curd and rice and drank his tea sitting on the spotless doorstep of the little cut-stone and timbered house .	Indoors the family chattered like happy sparrows as the women went about their housework .	while
His eyes slowly focused on her .	Her words filtered through the thousand thoughts and memories flooding across his mind .	as
Very young , korsten commented .	Bael was finished instructing his student .	when
And now i know she knows what i 'm really telling her .	I 'm rambling about allison doveney and mr .	while
Casey was a virgin .	I was just going to have to sit back and wait for her to be ready .	and
I would be shitting my pants .	I was behind my wife going that fast on a bike .	if
Now we must act in secrecy but our presence is no less vibrant in the world .	We have dwindled of late .	though
Without taking her gaze off ren , keita reached out .	Grabbed hold of the man 's balls through his trousers .	and
How long they had been swimming .	The light came to some kind of a grating in the water .	when
She held her breath in panic .	Nes tumbled loosely onto his back .	as
To become a vampire .	Youve scarified your blood and magic .	after
And i 'll call you barbie .	That 's what you go by .	if
She should be thinking .	She agrees to sex .	before
The room around me is frozen .	I turn to my right .	when
Winkler even looked gray .	We stepped off the plane .	when
He had never doubted that he would see this tonight .	The reality was astounding to him .	but
He had gone to the mountains .	He had seen it .	and
Choked on my tongue .	Julian blurted out the one admission that would get him killed in an instant .	as
Why you turned white .	I told you what psychopomps were and what it is they are supposed to do .	when
She already knew he 'd vehemently refuse to get rid of it : good .	She laughed out loud anyway before replying .	but
To seal the bargain , lindy had poured two shots of jack daniels , along with some papers , telling johnny , `` roll one for the road . '' .	Tossed his bag of reefer on the desk .	and
Charles had to fan me to keep me on my feet .	He grinned the whole time i was going through the lingerie department .	and
Surely , she understood that you had been forced to fight for your life . '' .	She came back to her senses .	when
His hands rose up to hold her face as he savored the moment .	As he cupped her jaw-line , he realized that it had lost its roundness in favour of the more angular lines of a woman .	and
`` just listen , '' she says .	She pokes me in the ribs .	as
When mcfergus checked his pocket .	The penny was gone .	also
Walter and i were just friends .	We were also pretending to be engaged .	but
Even though we have this new found historical bond between us , time and circumstance have kept us apart for almost fifty years .	We do not know much about each other at all .	so
She reached the elevator .	Clanged the metal door shut behind her , stabbing at the buttons with a shaking finger .	and
`` look meet me here in ten minutes , dressed and ready to go .	You want to do what we talked .	if
She 'd curl up .	He shouted how incompetent she was , how unattractive , how lacking .	while
It is obnoxiously flashy .	People stare when you arrive in it .	and
To remain behind with bowen .	I travel back to our lands to consult with graeme and apprise him of the situation .	while
I would get what i wanted , and it would continue costing me as long as i wanted it .	It would cost me something .	but
There was no surrender , not in that disorder .	Even the soldiers had desired it .	if
Admired her naked body .	She crawled under the sheets .	as
My mouth going dry .	His hot gaze meets mine .	when
I took to the road at .	I knew you would want to know .	as
Xavier had decided hed watch .	Learn , following duke from a distance until an opportune moment struck .	and
To run some distance more than once several times .	Hurl the heavy javelins .	and
As soon , knocking me back to my knees .	I did , an invisible sledgehammer landed in my gut .	as
She was at his side .	He could even deposit his shoes inside the closet .	before
Catch a glimpse of the black leather glove or black leather shoe of either al or max .	He ducked into a doorway or behind a kiosk or into the entrance of the subway .	as
Tabby took the ice and set aside the fast food cup .	She also instantly curled with her back facing me .	but
Ok , it was the only penthouse i 've ever seen .	It was still beautiful .	but
My body tightening and squeezing him .	I climbed higher toward another climax .	as
They ask for it .	I draw it in .	and
Mick said , peering up at the boats skipper , i want you to toss that net .	I give the signal .	when
I can pick a lock .	This place was built for people who knew more than me about escape plans .	but
So what allans lies .	He had initially believed .	if
It was long past midnight .	I gave up and went to bed .	when
Somehow it got spent in the wrong order .	The money came in .	when
His dark brown hair was a bit long , the ends reaching past his collar .	It looked soft and thick and so very tempting to touch .	but

The doors were open .	The horde was pushing its way into the hall .	and
There was one other option .	It was a long shot .	but

There 's one of the neighbors who says he pounded on the door , and .	When he looked at the woman who walked out of adams 's apartment , his left arm and shoulder went numb .	but
Why it now matches the murder weapon .	The barrel on that .45 you took from him was switched , it could explain .	if
We try , but the fall is always-will always be-there .	Succeed to a certain extent .	and
They 'll have made a camp , lit a fire , and have got happy an hour .	They 're out for a party .	if
It gave me the creeps .	I knew they wouldnt come into the lake .	but
He got good and drunk .	Waited for him to pass out again so she could drop you off at the neighbor ladys house .	and
Soon as al picked up , the interference would vanish .	Until then , i was left feeling disoriented .	but
Part of it was seeing the handiwork of man in all this overgrown jumble of wilderness .	He supposed part of it was the shape of the thing itself-that concrete cylinder jutting out of the ground .	but
In the camp all locked up .	He wasnt sure how long he was going to be gone .	because

To remain in my seat .	Axel finishes , it takes all my strength .	when
Sucked in a breath .	My eyes focused on the trail of red liquid smeared across the carpet .	as

Sean let the growl come .	With it , his words returned .	and

Technically i 'm violating the boundaries we set when we were talking the scene through .	She clearly wants to please me now , and is ready to suck it up .	but
Joshua shrugged , i dont know .	When they come out i may hear something about it .	but
I refreshed the site .	I waited for it to brew .	while
Talking to the jc killer and switched gears to put on a show by acting terrified .	She 'd actually found it .	if

I 'm not an absolute fatalist , if that 's what you mean . '' .	I 've seen things come out exactly the way the prophecy said they were going to far too many times for me to ignore it .	but

The old king took another bite of meat .	He chewed and swallowed it , before speaking again , i 've heard that you can fight , are my warriors speaking the truth , or do they lie .	but
There was a different problem .	The vehicle was barreling towards us at mach speed .	still
He was grunting but she understood him .	It was too difficult to speak .	though
But , i can make this take a long time , as many days as i choose .	You try to play the innocent with me or get all heroic and stubborn .	if
She wanted to dig in her heels and she also wanted to avoid causing a scene .	Refuse to accompany him .	but
She was standing over .	The girls watched her every move like predators waiting to attack .	while
Her gray eyes had narrowed in bliss .	He 'd made love to her .	as
It would certainly never come back to him .	He had no intention of putting his name and address on it .	because
Sweat dripped from me .	I walked down the sidewalk .	as
Hobbled to her master bathroom .	Kane bulled his way in and took over .	before
Who quickly got two fistfuls of green coat .	Pegged his prize to the brick wall .	and
You 're welcome . '' .	So you want to take 'em back to hole-in-the-road with you .	if
You just want us to think you are nothing more than a biosynth doctor .	I bet you are just like the rest of us , brimming with imagination .	but
Loups were contagious as hell .	I 'd got a walloping dose of lyc-v from brenna 's saliva .	and

As long . '' .	Claudia 's okay rooming with you .	as
Having researched it for decades , the ability to go out in real air and run , work up a sweat .	She was jaded about the current society .	though
She rushed over to answer it .	Was surprised to hear garys voice .	and
It rose from its knees , each vertebra visible beneath its black skin .	It rose to its full , imposing height .	as
I am going to believe you .	You say that you dont know about us .	when
Her skin was still humming .	His skin was still pressed to hers .	though
I would know that i had walked the path beforeand it had ended at a brick wall .	Even i never shared this experience with my true love .	if
When we returned to the marina .	Headed back to al 's .	and
That he 'd broken from the pack .	Become friends with someone the others had alienated .	and
Stilling her hips with a firm push of his hands .	She tried to grind .	when
I thought my head was hurting .	I have never felt pain like this , bumping unmercifully as the ambulance hurtles over every pothole with the speed of a wild horse .	but

The combined smell of bacon and waffles hit her head-on .	She entered the kitchen .	when
`` you can trust me , myme chlo , '' she tilted her head , saw the smile , and responded .	Lian smiled gently down and murmured .	when
He bit the bullet and called the cleaning service he occasionally used and arranged for them to come first thing monday .	He went food shopping on sunday .	then
He headed down to the dojo .	She crashed and he was sure she 'd be asleep for a while .	after
And if you try to steal the rod on your own i will challenge you to contests you can not possibly hope to win .	I told you not to .	after
Miss birdie retires to bed .	The `` msassh '' reruns go off at eleven .	after
This might be all you ever get from him , so be greedy and take it .	You can get it .	while

There i was in the same room with them .	They dreamed of ways to cut my throat .	while
It 's temperature humidity controlled and .	The book is ancient .	and
After adjusting my boobs in my push-up bra , i check my lipstick and grin , then zack coming .	I hear the doorbell .	when
I will run , when they are not , i will walk .	The streets are empty of people .	when
Mehi tried to reply , maybe with her name .	His voice only squeaked .	but
I can assure you .	Her mind is quite made up .	though
He 'd only meant it to be a quick , demonstrative caress .	The moment he 'd tasted her on his lips , it had turned into more .	but
She 'd write a book and title it stress and poverty : the guaranteed way to lose inches .	She had the time .	if
When the girls were young , it worked .	They babbled and needed help .	because
On me in 321 , she counted down to the droid .	Taking a deep breath .	before

The joint had to support her .	She had another rappel to make , longer than the first .	because
They came to an opening in the trees .	The prince saw a wooden cabin with a tall stone chimney off to their left in the shade of a large tree with white bark and fading red leaves .	and
I 've never been in a fight , never so much as socked anyone except fletcher .	I have the distinct feeling today is a wonderful day to rectify that .	but
Yes , sort of i could understand her reaction to my explanation .	It had enraged me so much the first time i had heard it .	because

It was only four in the afternoon .	It felt much later to both latianna and ivan .	but
They were sat in four rows .	The first row only held tony .	as

Cuto asks ? '' .	You have the radio on shower or beam .	if
It was no use .	She must 've had red wine .	as
Though , he noted a new addition to the room 's decoration .	He leaned back to allow mr. bodley to tuck the napkin under his chin .	as
None of this would have happened .	Marcie had done what i 'd asked .	if
She gave her mother half a smile .	Looked at her father .	and
How can they jump ahead of modern technology .	Foundational aspects of energy technology didnt even exist until thousands of years .	when
Even bon temps was feeling the storm 's effect .	Had been ever katrina had hit land .	and
We were far enough upstream that the water was fresh and sweet .	It was a tidal creek .	though

I watch it a moment longer .	From it i understand a little more .	and
And indeed her plate nearly as full as his .	She finally sat across from him .	when

You killed harry and moreau 's secretary . '' .	You blew it with karin and me .	but
The gods are at odds over our fate .	They were at troy .	as
Then he eased her onto her back .	Came down on top of her .	and
Her expression grim and determined .	I finished she was watching me .	when
There was no way he was going to risk getting killed .	He took a photo this go-around .	because
When he clasped her about the waist , she did .	He 'd told her and felt one of his hands grasp the back of her thigh and lift her leg .	as
Zinged through my entire body .	His chest pressed against me .	when
So , you 'd freeze your ass off when you sat on it .	You were to use it .	if
You 're not judging her .	You 've made the assumption that she 's into random hookups .	but
Its scent was still fresh .	The carnation was wilted after hours out of water .	though
It 's worth millions today .	It was hidden somewhere and .	if
`` right , chaperoning you two . '' .	This is my dream job .	because
Even when im holding .	Only using my natural strength .	and

When his mouth broke from hers .	His head moved , his temple sliding against her hair .	and
I asked , and he sighed .	We could use a hard disk drive .	if
`` i will give you your medication and relieve your pain , she said , `` .	First you have a job to do .	but
The alarm was quickly disabled .	Terry was unsure whether they had been quick .	but
Roemer told me that i must write down what had happened with this young woman as part of my scholarly work .	I can tell you , stefan , that what i wrote was most pitiful and brief and that is why i have not asked that you consult these old records .	but
Nikolai ripped away the remains of conrad 's tattered shirt .	Sebastian adjusted the water temperature and opened a bar of soap .	while
I can make out a man-like shape and panic clutches at my chest .	My eyes adjust to the darkness .	as
Surviving high school was bad .	I knew that both of us depended on the other to get through it .	but
So , i took a breath .	Pushed against the door in front of me .	and
As he retreated under his shelter , he fiddled with the knob on the baby monitor .	Heard nothing more than a steady susurration .	but
Though he was soon speaking to her in words of awed adoration , she was too distracted to hear his overtures .	He became jealous of her inattention .	and
She had instantly turned .	Come back to check on him .	and
`` , you 're .	I 'm not all fired up to let a big , fat jerk look after them .	although
She remembered that the carnival glass lampshade was locked up , raider was on guard , and the front door was locked .	The doubts assailed her .	when
The colonel was very quiet upset , but . '' .	I knew i 'd been warned .	and
His head turned mushy swelled up big as a gourd .	Scarce split the skin at all , but , only purply-red .	and
It 's very upsetting for such a nice family to be invaded by a runaway drug addict .	We will find the proper care for her and get her back to her family .	but
There was a casket in the center of the room that was opened .	In it was the blood of the men .	and
He thought of touching her , taking some of her joy and wonder into his heart ; he repelled himself .	The thought of his cold , vice-like fingers on her skin repelled him .	but
I let my eyes find the window .	I can do something else stupid .	before
I probably could 've gotten her past a few bases right there on her front porch .	That douche , matthew , never interrupted us .	if
Gunnar searched around , looking for any trace of where they had left to .	He found no clues .	but
I was afraid of the question itself .	I had to know .	but
She stared up at him .	He unfolded her clenched fingers and took the ring .	as
Maybe you could sleep with one of my friends .	We could call it .	and
She would play along for a while .	Then shed start in about how much fun we were having and whether we should consider this place for our honeymoon and which mementos should we get to reminisce in our old age .	but
To do this so bad today .	I saw the way these looked in your wedding dress .	when
Nothing changed , she noted .	She fastened it back on .	as
This would both reveal his identity .	Make him look like an idiot .	and
His eyes were huge .	He quietly held his arm out to her .	and
As luck would have it , she ended up in my class .	Her schedule had been messed up at the beginning of the year .	because
His coffee trying not to be too obvious .	He checks out her sweet ass while she is leaning over the table across from him to clear some dishes .	as
Bagabond looked back at the mirror .	Saw a girl in a beaded leather headband and a tie-dyed t-shirt .	and
You would be dead old man .	I hadnt been ordered to keep you alive .	if
Caleb grabbed him under the arms .	Jordan started to slip .	when
I 've always liked your necklace . '' .	It 's not exactly politically correct .	though
I came to you because i 've spent the evening trying to convince the others to go after the artifact now rather than .	They are all too afraid to take definitive action .	but
We cast shadows on the wall , the ceiling , as if we lay at the center of some great light , some great flame .	We became that light , that fire , that heat .	and
Ye were playing the busybody , snooping around in my soul .	I was pouring my heart out to you just now in a kiss .	while
I warn you , it is not for the faint of heart .	You have never enter the forest of despondency .	if
We reach the citys center .	Then will you be given instructions on how were to proceed .	and
`` that 's not in the rules , '' she warned him .	He released her mouth .	when
Xander and xavier must be related .	They looked nearly identical and their magical current was only marginally different .	because
Hooves , hearts , and wings pounded .	Shimmers form raced forward at blinding speed .	as
To finish my breakfast .	Get back to my room pronto. .	and
There is a crowd around the mirror asks something about goings-on .	A policeman waits near the mirror .	because
They strolled onward , not saying .	She allowed herself to slide her arm back around his waist as before , leaning into him as he resettled his arm over her shoulders .	but
Stopped , i suspect .	The body ran out of blood .	because
Kay would ordinarily have found miles rather smooth and over-familiar .	She was determined to suspend judgement .	but
The clues were subtle .	He was definitely nowhere near vista , colorado .	but
She leaned out over the railing .	Spread her arms like a sea bird .	and
His skin was again normal .	He was grateful that the blanket covered him .	and
Tucker made a lame attempt to juke past joey .	Joey was too fast and he grabbed him up and spun him .	but
I 'm thankful for your loyalty .	Right now weare beggars .	but
A rattle of automatic fire echoed to them , sounding like firecrackers .	He could find out .	before
How she 'd looked at seven .	She 'd been so sick pam and i both thought she might die on us .	when
I 'll find the room , ryland .	We have to buy ourselves some time .	but
He sat down close to her .	She could hear him .	so
Maybe javier is setting you up to distract them .	He swoops in and takes over .	while
They were actually going back across the river , and she just happened to catch me going into the factory .	Katie happened to look over her shoulder toward the opposite bank .	when
Going over financial records with one of his subordinate ship captains .	He happened to glance out the window .	when
Under a patchy sky of gray-purple clouds and a crescent moon , a clock reading a quarter to midnight stood high on a corner across the street .	Watched an appeased throng file out to the parking garage .	and
She purred her satisfaction with that answer .	Snuggled up against him .	and
He dropped one of his wrenches .	The bang of the metal sounded like a gunshot .	and
She looked him in the eye .	She said it , her gaze never wavering .	when
He had taught her right from wrong let her make her own mistakes .	Told her what he expected .	and
Shawn could drive him to the hardware store across town , where he could make some big money boosting .	Instead he would have to walk three miles to go rip off the local drugstore .	but
All i could do was open myself up to my new life .	Hope that in the end , it would be .	and
There was no sound .	The pool of light hit his heavy duty , combat grade leather boots and black colored warm trousers .	as
She 'd imagined that being linked to him would be terrible , because of his madness .	She sensed none of it .	but
She fought back a shudder .	She imagined his hand coasting just a few inches .	when
Our passports and the photographs show two people completely different from our true selves . '' .	Indeed , anybody is remotely interested in us .	if
My phone was the only thing i owned that had survived our disaster at sea .	It was useless here , an alien object .	but
Hughs eyes were still on joan .	He gave a soft , clucking noise .	but
That 's heads bowed .	Everyone around izzy kneeled .	when
At least a good looker was going to end it for me .	This was my last moment on earth .	if
They 'd been left over .	Her great-grandpa had shifted the stream that now ran around rock island to bring water closer to the house and dry out a neighbor 's field .	when
He could reach the drawer .	Tossed me a box of red hots .	and
His time had come .	His patience , the years of waiting and watching , had been rewarded .	and
His face changed , slipping .	His eyes remained steady on hers .	but
I would have noticed she made lasagna and garlic bread .	I wasnt so wrapped up in my own world .	if
From outside , the sound of the girls playing in the drying creek came in .	Pepper whined , wanting to join them .	and
That was as much .	She could stand of being .	as
Sure , it seemed that way .	You looked at john macintyre .	when
She seemed a little mechanical .	She left but that was probably because she felt overwhelmed .	as
The brisk morning air was invigorating .	All too soon , they stood at the gap in the wall near west hall .	but
Humans also came to the fight clubs , and .	Some liked to abscond with things .	but
It took a concerted effort to sift the weevils from the flour we had left .	It was a great dinner weevils and all accompanied with canned green beans and a fresh salad wilted with hot vinegar , sugar , and joyces homemade bacon bits .	still
I open my mouth to say no .	Tegan beats me to it .	but
Half crouched beneath its oak , he hacked at inchfield 's arms and side and legs .	His plate turned every stroke .	but
I hesitated before moving , afraid to make any noise .	My body wanted to uncurl and stretch out .	but
She 's a couple of years older than me .	Was good to me .	and
She had pushed all thoughts of the section to one side and concentrated on berger 's problem .	Using jonasson 's mobile .	after
Nicolette had impaled her new husband on their wedding night .	Even adorno had consummated his marriage to her .	as
He handed over the passport from the envelope .	Disappeared into an adjoining room .	and
To get through his list .	Even all it does is eliminate the names on it .	if
He 's going crazy already . '' .	He 's not even married to her .	and
He could get his head .	He chucked it on the floor .	before
`` can i have your picture ? '' .	I can show santa what i want for christmas .	so
Heavy , plodding footsteps sounded .	Another person entered the salon .	and
I decided to check out the innards of the reefer to see how things were going .	I was up in that area of the rig .	while
I 've been running some figures in my head , and .	When the denarians pulled up those huge signs , they had to have a lot of power to do it .	but
The land rover had dunlopillo cushions .	The ripple-edged tarmac and the pitted bends of nassau 's coastal road were tough on the springs and the quivering afternoon sun was a killer .	but
Varg would tear him to pieces .	So actually catching up to the cane would be suicide .	and
I saw the punch coming .	I suspected that if scott byerly had any power as a meta , he did .	and
The knights were discussing points of precedence and etiquette .	Their attention was distracted .	and
What you made me .	You left me out in the desert .	when
He tried to cling to her .	She fell through his arms like a liquid , collecting on the floor .	but
He made no sound .	He hit the floor in a boneless heap .	as
He could hear the sounds of activity just around the slight bend .	He was removed from them .	but
Frankly , the shit made jim shrivel .	He blocked that from her .	but
Where just ten minutes ago bob had wondered .	It was an intrigue in the making he now knew it was a conspiracy .	if
Here , it was always daylight .	They were always on the move , seeing new terrain yet never getting tired , thirsty or hungry , sharing the camaraderie of some interesting and friendly souls .	and
Biting your goddamn lip .	I f**king lose it right here on the train .	before
A rat might come out .	Nibble me all the time .	and
Elena 's arm brushed his , and they exchanged a look of perfect understanding , amusement flowing through the bond between them .	She stepped up next to him .	as
Yours ... '' setrakian made his move .	The silver tip of the stake made a tiny scraping noise , revealing its presence a mere instant before it flew toward the thing 's heart .	but
Im going to turn up the hill .	You just keep walking her along the fence .	if
I mean , some strange things have happened while i was traveling around with my foreseer power .	... that was too much .	but
Donovans son gags , then vomits onto the bed .	The gun is finally pulled .	when
Begins doing his best imitation of the king .	He sings about fools rushing in .	as
I tried calling him .	His voicemail picked up .	but
He stopped at a pemex .	Had the fluids topped off .	and
My father had copious amounts of money .	My mother enjoyed spending it .	and
Sitting at the vanity .	Sara reached for the round brush and hairdryer .	while
Truly , nearly as surprised .	Aunt debourgh announced her engagement .	when
Bruce almost wanted to chase after the muskrat .	He managed to suppress his instinct for the greater cause .	but

His day began at 0400 hours .	Ended at 2300 hours .	and
She tried to stay calm and think .	She had just seen steel shot in cold blood .	but

Him utterly enveloped in flames .	Doing nothing about it .	but
It had been to notice they had attracted the attention of their family at the tennis court and of three ducks from the nearby pond .	She 'd finally looked up .	when
Mark slipped out of the front door .	Headed off to the tanakas three-storey house about 600 meters down a road , that ran perpendicular to the shotengai .	and
The charges were all dropped .	Jason , and the rest of his family , joined forces against her .	because
Again she released her hold on the vacuum cleaner .	He waved her over to the couch .	when
I ordered a stop and sent men to look within for vampyres .	So we pushed past a door .	as

In his head , he was still a young man .	Time had definitely taken a toll on his body .	but
She kicked the jeans free of her feet .	Stood in front of him in her bra and panties .	and
Maybe they 'd have to pay the men more , but iia would be bound to think up some sort of scheme .	It would be worth it .	and
He heard footsteps in the hall .	Several minutes hed seated himself on the edge of his bed .	after
I knew you would be a good daddy , and it did n't . .	I thought that you being a good daddy would make me a good mother .	but
Then dealt himself two vikes washing the pills down with tap water .	Rinsing out the glass in the sink .	and
Nora tried to rip up the map in ordor to tako it with hor .	It was glued to the bottom of the drawor .	but
One arm waited for a pause in between laser rounds .	Then struck fast , slamming into the skyrattler .	and
That was my booty call and ? '' .	He lived next door .	but
Thankfully the cab driver didnt pursue further conversation .	Turned up the music frank sinatra belting out my way .	but
He unbuttoned my blouse .	Tossed it to the floor , where it rested in a black , silken pile .	and
Something occurs to me .	Asher opens the front door .	as
All thought of what had driven him to self-destruction vanished .	The eternal , instinctual , struggle for survival ignited anew within him .	and
Demetrius said his people would soon claim this realm .	He urged zach to join them .	and
Beautiful but expensive , thought miles .	He stepped back to look at the hundreds of impatiently bobbing balloons that were now in position .	as
Not to stare too long at becca 's retreating figure .	She jogged down the beach with her friends .	as
We 'd have someone on the inside . '' .	As a bonus , he could make all the issues of my case vanish in one day .	and
It meant they still lived , and if so , then perhaps they werent entirely too late .	The people were in pain .	if
All trade had stopped .	Her fisherfolk did not dare put out into the bay .	and
I 'm sure tara will understand .	We go to vegas .	if
I can imagine that my father threatened her , probably with no money or something like that .	I 'd like to hear that from her .	but
Apprehensive , uncertain , he got .	Closed all the velvet draperies .	and
Hacker clapped a hand to the side of his skull .	Banged it several times .	and
The house had sat vacant for so long and .	Was falling into such disrepair .	but
`` do i ask what flavor , or just let it drop , ? '' .	You have to threaten me with the old if-i-tell-you-then-i-have-to-kill-you routine .	before
Pulled a sheet of paper from a lucite tray .	Grabbing a pen and beginning to scribble .	before
`` okay , michael . '' .	This is what you want .	if
We have become accustomed to her devious ways .	This is different-she abandoned her duties when we most needed her .	but
Evidence of the beating hed taken .	His lips curled back and his teeth were bared in preparation for the strike he was about to make .	but
She was thrilled that he 'd felt the same thing she was .	It was still no good .	but
So he popped into dillions drug store .	Heading on to mcdonalds and a strong cup of coffee .	before
I dont know if you know .	She asked jeff if he or i could stay and ensure that nicholas and kayla are alright with their transformations .	but
The person was tall slender and sounded female .	It was too dark to make out who it was , but .	and
The arrow had been withdrawn .	Not used she continued .	but
His rhythm faltered for a couple of beats .	He continued , `` i wanted to go for one more run down the mountain .	before
I would play the piano in that suite .	Sometimes even sing , with the ghost of the voice i 'd once had .	and
He takes out his wallet from his pocket , then offers me a smile .	Tucks the card behind his norm license .	and
She used to sing to me .	I was a baby .	when
How could he tell suzy of his feelings and .	Still be the head of the household .	but

He said with genuine kindness .	You get hungry again let me know .	when
Would the archangels accept her back .	She became too human .	if
Bubba rolled down his window .	We approached the tollbooths outside the sumner tunnel .	as
His almost imperceptible flinch .	He recovered and went on .	before
Who got pulled out of school .	Just we graduated , after rumors circulated that she had been found with a boy , an uncured , in deering oaks park after curfew .	before
But either the volume was turned down , or hed gotten too used to hearing them .	For some reason he couldnt seem to heed those alarms at the moment .	because

He got sent away to boarding school .	We were twelve and joined the military as soon as he turned eighteen .	when
Sal eyed him suspiciously , fearing he was drunk .	He smiled and stood behind sara and listened to the conversation .	but
Leah had been broken .	He 'd been wrong .	and

He asked for my leave to sleep in the barn .	I would have obliged him were it not for lady linae who insisted on giving him one of our guest chambers .	and
Duncan 's body twisted .	A fire seemed to burn beneath his skin .	and
Geoffrey produced a whistling hearing aid from the side of his head .	Fiddled with it until the noise stopped .	and
I regained every last bit of myself .	My vision cleared enough to see the light of love in mercedes eyes .	when
I will do it .	This you are not on your own .	but
She often worked out on her own in addition to riding her bike .	She had never had someone push her as hard as leo had today .	but
His fashionably long hair slicked .	Held in a tail .	and
The twisting branches were in full bloom , abundant with bright red fruit .	The long paths between the rows of trees were nothing but ankle-high grass dotted with apples already fallen from their stems .	and
Thanks for the help .	Welli was sure i really messed things up .	as
Elation swirled through him .	He tipped her chin up to him .	as

She scowled at his words .	She looked at nykyrian .	as
Ill be captured and restrained , and killing two redemption soldiers doesnt .	I run up and start wielding my sword to free him .	if
Not telling me any of this before she died .	Yet i was angry at her .	also
Maybe she could ignore cosmic issues with deep meaning .	She just made a list .	if
To catch their breath .	They both took a few minutes , claire knew her entire world had just changed .	as
She laughed at his groan .	She hurried up the stairs .	as
Retelling diana filardis dream .	Brian sits down across from me .	when
That had ordinarily been .	The first coats of paint were applied .	when
At first i thought he hadnt seen me .	Once in a while i caught him watching me .	but
Jim had had no clue where to go ... and led them to an abandoned three-story walk-up .	Then dog had appeared in their path .	but
Though , we dropped .	We could reach the end .	before
Water heaters of today 's caliber been invented .	I would have placed a large amount of money on a wager that einstein 's theory of relativity had first come to him while he was doing what i was .	when

Rick had approached both ian and i .	I was the only one hard up enough for cash to consider it .	but
Simon raced past the smoke .	Leaped , hitting the second man so hard they both lifted out of the broken trail and landed in fresh snow .	and
A trickle of blood ran down his cheek .	Luckily , it had only grazed him .	but
We were almost stifled by the smoke .	Were compelled to take refuge within the car , where , until the electric lights had been turned on , darkness so black that it oppressed the strained eyeballs prevailed .	and
He let his fork clang .	He dropped it onto his plate , and caridad promptly hurried out from whatever task she was doing to scoop it up and replace it with coffee .	as
Then , her body rose .	Her feet had even received the signal to stand .	before
Why has she returned .	She must know what you might do to her .	when

All you could do was watch .	Her life unfolded before your eyes .	as
At first dennis blamed the ineptness of the analysts and he too came up empty-handed .	Chose to bore through the data himself .	but

He was in his late fifties .	He died of a heart attack .	when
A great opportunity has been offered to our children .	It is our duty to do the best we can by them .	and
Or maybe it was .	She was the one person whose thoughts were closed to me , a mystery i longed to solve .	because

There was a sharp ping , making my eyes narrow .	A seed hit my biggest spell pot and ricocheted into me .	when
He tried to contain his amusement .	His laughter escaped when a blush overtook haven 's face .	but
To be a part of the childs life .	He hurt you and it will still hurt you to carry on seeing him with another woman .	because
Tavi hunched his shoulders against her tone and gathered the scarlet cloak closer around him .	The fabric might ward off the sensation of isolation her words brought him .	though
Jones pulled something else from olivias paperwork on the case .	The satnav guided them through the streets of rye hill , a suburb west of newcastle city centre .	as
What the hell had he been thinking .	Just how much blood did she have left .	and
And her smile brightened .	She took in the couple .	as
It brings out the worst in us .	Somebody hurts those we love .	when
Adarro is an ass .	I 'm sure he made no effort not to be .	and

But those three words had totally thrown her , ; desperation that she could also feel sizzling in the air .	Especially the desperation in his eyes gave emphasis to that claim .	when
Both to keep his face hidden .	The girl reeked of cheap perfume .	and
She motioned to ragnar with a snowy-white talon .	He moved across the hall , those in the chamber watching him .	and
I know i have a bad reputation , but i do know when i need help .	As you know , i do have many doubles that i cant speak for their mannerisms .	and
Larry called over to me from inside the store .	I walked back towards him with a new , confident sense of purpose .	and
I should quit the bookstore .	Find something else to do .	and

But the bromance would never have developed .	Not initiated by dickey .	if
Elvi 's eyes slid back to the end of the hall .	The fifth and final man started up with mabel and teddy .	as
It might just be jax 's twisted imagination .	The gloves almost seemed like an erotic touch .	but
You could have died a man . '' .	Only i 'd had the strength to kill you myself .	if
They decide im crazy .	Need to be locked up in a padded cell with a straightjacket and an iv drip of sedation medication .	and
Gave up parked moneypenny a block .	I cruised for a few minutes , just in case rock-star-quality parking was available outside her town house , but .	and
I would have sold tickets .	I wanted an audience .	if
She pulled tony 's car over .	Went to turn off the engine .	and

You brought honor to his death .	You defeated those demons .	when
I 'd had a number of boyfriends in high school .	Nothing really serious until i was a senior .	but
It was two evenings hence , and as the grand door opened to both himself and tohrment , they were met by a doggen whose eyes were filled with the tragedy of hope .	Darius finally walked into the home of the abducted female 's family .	when
I stayed with him until visiting hours were .	I picked up where beverlee left off on page fifty-six .	and
He 'd barely tasted her .	He felt an awful stinging pain in his palm .	before
Kitka put her front paws on daria 's shoulders , and continued .	She tried to pull .	when
Sort ofi dont know what a camera lens is .	I dont know much about earth .	and

To find a heavy frown on her forehead .	She looks at the woman stood silently in front of us .	as
The dornier 's propellers continued to flicker over .	Its side cargo hatch swung open , disgorging a single figure .	but
Her body being jerked back and .	The car tried to take off to no avail .	as
Madison tried to call to him , to warn him of the coming danger .	Her voice caught in her throat .	but
That is true sir .	The cost of the war was terrible .	but
He looked around for his ak-47 .	Found it by one of the dead bodies .	and
It was just they had told her in sunday school .	She 'd been young : when a saint died , you smelled flowers .	when
It was evil 's last chance to undo god 's plan for the redemption of mankind .	As the son of man hung on his cross , they threw everything they had at him to prevent him from doing his father 's will .	and
She wore my eastwood tennis sweatshirt .	She 'd gotten cold .	because
I need to stake out a route for my morning constitutional .	I am going to stay here and jog my mind into continual productivity .	if
They looked at each other .	Marcie rolled her eyes and they began laughing .	then
Momma said she loved him .	She loved pills more .	but
She squatted on her haunches .	It sat down and scratched an ear .	as
Jagr rolled to the side .	Gathered her in his arms .	and
He detested being stuck in the sterile environment .	It spoke of weakness and vulnerability , two things a warrior could never be .	because
I was saving these for the sunrise . '' .	I want you to open them now-before the day begins .	but
Who first stirredblinking my eyes .	Shifting about while declaring .	and
Leena sighed in frustration .	She hoped they could do more bonding by opening up more to one another .	as
Ltc colson approached , major , im surprised to see you back here so soon , is this an official visit .	He came through the front door .	as
He stopped , but he slowly headed in my direction .	I thought that he might stay where he was , about halfway down the aisle .	and
Suffocated under the weight of heavy stones .	He refused to enter a plea at his trial after he was falsely accused of wizardry .	because
Book bag acquired , she blew shane and michael an air kiss .	She hit the back door , heading out into a cold morganville fall .	as
This is your calling , leonard , and you have to work to get .	Dont you forget it .	but
It was as dark as the rock itself .	Reflected metallically the dazzling tempest below .	but
He went by foot and by hay cart when the weather was .	In the winter , he hitched his two black horses to a sledge , kissed his children , and set out in the snow .	and
Looked back and forth between the couple .	He rubbed the grease from between his fingers with the gritty dirt .	as
Finally , they rolled to the foot of the mountain and into a big creek .	There my uncle night walker drowned the cougar .	and
Delilahs leather duster was form-fitting down to the waist .	It flared out , with no buttons to allow ease of movement while walking .	then
Balancing the hamsters and his completely useless sword-cane .	Trying to dig his cell phone out of his jacket pocket .	while
Your safeguards keep others .	They do not keep us in .	but
How chase 's treatment is going .	He 'll be ready for me to come get him in a few days .	and
She felt the icy palm of stone on her knees .	She knelt next to mina .	as
The second man 's soul also rushes at me .	I am distracted by this task .	while
First bestowed on her .	She pledged herself to his service .	when
He had talked about his cousin lottie over the years .	Id never met her before today .	but
He thought all clandestine services were slightly mad .	Since the british had paid for his last two years in medical school , he accepted his part of the bargain .	but
Wilfried was constantly at the cattle post now riding the horses .	Roz came with him on weekends .	and
You travel east from kin , through the woods between the lakes n and k .	Follow the river aro .	and
You 'd come here for gus .	He told you that travis had him .	if
Traiven knows our contact .	He can probably help us , to convince him to join us .	so
It was not that he actually denied what he saw .	He simply refused to acknowledge it .	but
I had no answer for that .	As i walked through the backyard , the longish grass tickling my bare legs , it felt like falling .	but
His two companions , being seen only as servants themselves , managed to slip .	My father and i were taken .	but
Their grey camo almost made them invisible .	They pressed against the filthy buildings .	as
After all it was pam .	Anyone was good at disposing of humans or bodies .	if
They 'd rather have privacy .	They visit with friends and family .	while
She took in a deep breath .	Turned again to face the hall .	and
She rarely had the time to clean and gave them a good scrubbing .	The femreaux talked on her phone to just about everyone she knew as she prepped food for the next day .	while
... lady ramkin made herself a cup of cocoa .	Listened to the rain gurgling in the pipes outside .	and
Giving him a playful eye over her shoulder .	She moved toward his couch .	as
Then , i still could not believe .	I saw you coming into camp today ... with my own eyes .	when
Dragged him into a room .	Any blood could pool on the ground .	before
The few hairs hed had been combed in a feeble attempt at concealing his bald head .	Stretched across his scalp .	and
Jonas sorted through his limited set of options .	Then met caitlin evanger 's eyes .	and
The enemy fell to the ground in silence .	He grasped at his throat with a look of shock in his eyes .	as
Specific sisters sought out myrddraal .	They had been ordered .	as
I am sure i wish them much luck .	They like to try it .	if
I turned around to make sure she was paying attention to where she was walking .	We passed a couple in the center of the aisle .	as
Jordan writhed and fought .	Spike pulled him of olaf .	as
I breathed a sigh of relief .	The car traveled away from the woman .	as
I 'd be glad to see him .	I was afraid of the answers he would have for me .	but
To be a ballet dancer or not , i didnt really care .	Kyle did , and the more we laughed the more he thought we were winding him up .	but
He swiped me across the chest .	He flew off to fight some other dragons .	before
I opened a can of worms .	I began searching out whitney 's supporters .	when
I 'm sorry , mr. rodano . '' .	It might as well not have happened .	but
And , i suddenly wanted to know .	I 'd never asked or wondered about his evenings in the viper .	while
Quickly left the room .	I could change my mind .	before
She could wait for a table .	He circled around the block to look for a spot .	while
She needed an assistant , she 'd explained .	Her grandson worried about her , especially after she 'd broken her hip .	because
He 'd seen more than he 'd told her , that was certain .	Wanted her to wriggle .	and
So how well do i really know him .	I have not seen this before .	if
Caillen glared at her .	He waited for the sound that would end his life .	as
When he saw the broken flagon , he uttered a blistering curse .	Demanded to know what had happened .	and
His wolf had also sensed her withdrawal as well as her pain .	Both ate at him .	and
Sharon and i went to high school .	You 'll want to interview them .	so
It was practically empty .	I still sat in a booth in the corner to gain some privacy .	but
The director 's breath rasped out , weak .	Pate groaned when shane touched him .	and
But i was afraid , afraid of failing was there anything worse than failing her .	If i failed , i would be failing brynna , and .	because
Which she 'd removed .	Going to the bathroom .	before
He turned to joshua .	They were out of sight .	when
We were in a car accident . '' .	I woke up several days later like this .	and
The happy couple only had eyes for each other .	The preacher spoke in an easy , jovial tone that added some liveliness to the ceremony .	as
To get married , mother .	Even it makes you feel better .	if
`` and , my family will sue you so fast , you ... you ... '' she tried to think of something suitably threatening , but her mind was still fuzzy .	Anything i said to you ever comes up in print .	if
I 'd initially wanted to learn about my birth parents .	I possessed an overdeveloped sense of curiosity .	because
It in no way diminished the pain it caused her .	Frances understood the reasons behind the doctors self-imposed exile .	while
All the buildings were sparsely furnished .	So much of parona was made of stone that they had yet to come across anything suitable .	and
I 'd call tyler .	I thought i was in serious jeopardy .	if
If we did , we would try to reason with her . '' .	That has proven futile .	but
I 'd commit a crime every day .	It meant i got to do this .	if
Granted , she 'd just been in her own place and it was still unnerving .	Probably would have just passed out on the couch .	but
The old cursor 's hair was in disarray , as if from sleep .	He clutched a sealed letter in his hand .	and
Thorn attempted to sit up .	Was again frustrated in his attempt by the thick gauze around his torso which prevented him from being able to bend .	but
`` sprain it then , '' he returned as she made it to him leaned her body into his .	Curled her fingers around his forearm .	and
His lips were warm on my skin .	I too was focused on the fact that he was not coming to drive me home .	but
The sergeant pushed back from the desk .	Walked to the door .	and
Maybe we can trace it . '' .	I can find a tracking device on the ship .	if
We 've learned just about as much from him .	We 're likely to .	as
What his mother and brother would say .	They learned that something had finally pierced through the weary anger that clung to him .	if
Locked onto my sister 's face .	I knew that he was going to punch her as hard as he could-and that he could easily break her neck with that one blow .	and
Then she turned to me and ! '' .	She roared , `` .	and
Now she wished that her sister had come , but .	She had never thought that her friends here would not believe her .	and
When one of the couches broke a leg under the combined weight of the four boys .	The smaller children started wailing .	and
Both riley and megan jumped .	The operative turned , flipping her black hood over her hair , and began walking across the parking lot .	but
She reaches a hand down to wipe away her drawing .	I touch her wrist .	but
Stefan grabbed for him .	Fury twirled out of his grasp .	but
The scraping of the guardsmens feet .	They gathered round echoed with finality through the courtyard grounds .	as
He 'd want it pointed out to him .	He had a flaw .	if
She 's tall . '' .	So is her mother .	but
She was not sure .	She could continue to fight against it .	if
It 's important to come home .	Even you grow up and move .	when
There had been people who had questioned their plans closely , almost cross-examining them .	The look in their eyes had been one of longing rather than contempt or anger .	but
My ears rang and the accursed ringing when i climbed to my shaky feet and began staggering toward the flaming remains of homers shack .	I couldnt hear anything .	but
I almost went with mr. short guy douche bag . '' .	He seems to suffer from the short guy complex .	because
She wanted to grab him and hold tight .	She locked her arms at her sides .	but
You jumped inside the tail of a rattlesnake .	Climbing a long spiral staircase to get to the top .	after
Then the members usually sit on mats and during rainy seasons .	The floors are wet .	when
It sounds ; or perhaps were angry . '' .	They did not feel .	as
She gives me the ghost of a smile .	Turning back around , shutting out the world around her .	before
Now was better than .	Sooner would have been better than .	although
They were working out , bench-pressing could have done .	Squatting more weight than five humans combined .	and
I 'm not supposed to go untethered .	Without my leash i could get way out .	but
A spelled charm is on the ship directly under the door .	Another is on the staircase at the top .	and
To shake and squirm .	The earth beneath them were trembling .	as
`` what 's really going on in our house while we 're out here ? '' .	There 's always a question tugging at your subconscious .	because
Lawrence realised it was some sort of deformed bird .	Knew they regularly ate dragonflies .	and
Two targets was still a failure .	It was better than nothing .	but
The man 's chest rose .	Fell in a smooth , even rhythm .	and
I know you were in a bad way last year .	Savanna and i were planning our future .	while
Reed greeted us with a smile .	We made our way over to him .	as
What was going through his mind when he stared at her like now , so intensely and .	He kept his distance on the other hand .	although
Even that was the right thing .	But it meant - christian .	still
She was stubborn and hated to lose an argument .	She let it go when she realized he was .	so
Jacksons legs felt like lead , and somehow he managed to move .	He wasnt sure if he could follow .	but
That took us out here to this backwoods road .	You couldnt stand the thought of staying in a hotel .	because
Listen your house is burnt down .	Miss i dont know if anybody told you this .	but
They were all much older than her not very friendly .	Mari tried making friends with the other stray cats on the wharf , but .	and
She neither wanted to relive nor share with anyone , holding that new life in her hands and helping it into the world would forever rank as one of the most amazing events of her life .	Even the experience was chock full of details .	though
The hatchback made a loud thunk .	I closed it , which sent me ducking behind the car .	when
Sean reached to put his hand on her arm .	Resisted at the last second , landing limp at his side .	but
It was the press .	Ive listened to the tapes .	but
He were suddenly aware of the great joke .	No longer found it funny .	and
She worked part time at the dealership and lived at home while majoring in finance at shawnee u .	She graduated from high school .	when
He would tell her in his own time .	He wanted her to know about his experiences in the war .	when
The willys should do it .	You keep her wound up and use an educated foot on the clutch .	if
Her cheeks were flushed .	She left the detective alone in the room with his thoughts .	as
Chester flopped into it then onto her face .	Climbing ungracefully back into her hair .	before
And each level only has around thirty students .	Quantum high is so small .	because
`` i 'd gladly take him up on the offer , '' the luxen said .	Then chuckled when i shuddered .	and
But now i wondered .	He 'd secretly been piecing me together like a puzzle , out of his own deep interest .	if
Later my vision cleared .	I lost all interest in stick .	and
Maybe you could see .	Your parents would like to come .	if
They had a fight .	She left and after her parents turned her .	before
I put my hands .	Said , `` easy there , gunslinger .	and
I had no need to spot the dying .	Every need to avoid the living , which sensing their pulses allowed me to do .	but
Claire hung up the phone .	Conor had time to interject .	before
Who had to journey hundreds of miles .	They returned to the locales they had left for heaven on earth .	when
She could ask him what he was planning to do with the gun .	She feared he might answer her .	but
Hopping up and down .	The wicked whip snapped and cracked at his bloodied feet despite all his dancing .	as
I see a tiny smile cross sarah 's face .	She turns her face back to her knees .	before
My emphasis on the word `` gift '' was decidedly sarcastic .	The jury was out i agreed with luke 's terminology .	still
He 'd sit by the door .	The council meetings ran , like a dog .	while
They were all very upset .	Reluctantly agreed to the meeting .	but
She might go bust .	We dont find a way to get it .	if
The boy was not crushed by his loss , but .	Rather was determined , perhaps more so , than his father to finish the project and become a veritable lord in this strange land .	but
She would tell her a little more .	She got to school .	when
No witch will survive .	The vampires are desperate for blood .	when
I could try to find work in the fall river mills .	That 's too far from home , and jobs are scarce .	but
I mean only the full tapestry , akasha .	The thing is seen as part of nature , and by nature i mean nothing sacred .	when
You want to work magic on someone .	You 've got to believe in it .	because
Then longbow sounded a sharper note .	The bowmen released their arrows in unison .	and
Andy withered to avoid his gaze .	Looked down at the floor .	and
`` have a seat , '' tripp said .	He came up behind me .	as
Propping her head up against and outstretched branch .	He considered his possibilities .	as
We called that number .	It 's already been disconnected .	and
As she came closer , the shifters behind her began to change into beasts with snarls and cracks .	Snaps of their bones .	and
Instead of just played that damn piano for your whole life , you might be able to get me some real care .	You had gotten a real job like your brothers .	if
Within seconds reached a high frequency .	The magnets were activated .	as
She 'd been willing to consider sleeping with him .	There 'd been no jewelry or fake commitments involved .	when
He must release the beast but he had to control it at the same time .	He was the ghost .	when
The room , like the hallway outside , is blue .	Here it is clear where the light is coming from .	though
Bad with marlene , i sure .	Hell am not going to take that chance with you .	as
Stifling a cry of pain , he tried to scratch it .	The gossamer of silk settled over his skin , as sticky as super glue , pasting the larva to his cheek .	but
Waves of guilt washed through her .	She watched peasants with sunken cheeks walk around the village square in simple robes and cloaks .	as
By then she was sitting .	Fiddling with a flower which she had plucked .	and
I know i wasnt around at the time .	You see im worth the wait .	but
To meet her eyes .	He knew that she was trying and failing to find a way out of this .	though
To be sorted through at a later date .	Attention could be given to separating those who were really black from those who were just enraged by the loss of their aes .	when
Yet , where they camped , there was still a significant amount of mistless daylight , and .	They also had enough tents to hold all of the soldiers , something they 'd lacked when moving the villagers .	and
He left it there because that was probably as much as petey could understand .	His mind continued on its own course .	but
It had been instantaneous , and tuesday cleared her throat , suddenly unnerved .	The corner of his mouth had risen slowly and .	when
When she 'd just laughed .	Deemed his domineering ways tres charmant , and then he 'd been angered when she 'd reminded him that she already had a place to stay .	and
He finished shaving , welcomed the hot water beating down on his body .	Then leaned against the tiled wall .	and
His stunted legs cramp .	He climbed up to it , all too aware of what an absurd spectacle he must be .	as
`` besides , '' he said .	He spread a thick , soft , red-and-white-checked blanket on the grass , `` i like watching you eat . '' .	as
She sounded , and her husband fraternizing with them all .	As she suspected london of being suddenly overrun with were-wolves , ghosts , and vampires .	though
You 'll run out of that long . '' .	I get tired of hitting you .	before
We drove for about a half mile .	Coming to a super-duper-ultra-hyper-mart .	before
I was sure id miss some of my doohickeys .	The space in the new kitchen couldnt be beat .	but
To grab the horn .	Run off to his or her masters .	and
It made my stomach drop .	Just it had the first time id seen it a handful of hours .	as
He brushed his arm against mine .	He reached around me for another cupcake .	when
Had been hot and possessive , and something fierce and primitive within him had raised its head and roared for release .	It rested on the redhead .	when
She had to make some minor preparations .	She could start the life-boat , as we later called it .	before
When i looked up , i realized zayne was standing .	He knew what had really gone down that night .	and
Jean claude dupont is the ambassador of france to the u.s. .	The third guy is whoa .	and
Rachel must have been 4 inches shorter than me .	Certainly tried to close the gap with amazing heels .	but
He climbed in and sat down beside her .	Pausing to issue instructions to his driver .	after
Lucan 's stare tore through that bullshit .	The words even left rio 's lips .	before
It 's hard on her .	There 's only so much i .	because
Just below the gaping jaws ; the shaft protruded from one side , the steel head from the other .	In a dream balthusa saw a short throwing-spear transfixing the mighty neck .	as
Fast he 'll have no choice .	To come down hard on the russians .	but
`` we were able to keep her hydrated .	We had no way to feed her .	but
You 're a guardian , one of the living dead .	Yet you want us to place the welfare of a living child into your hands .	and
This is not francisco . '' .	Now you have proof .	and
Luther had told the nun that he was looking to make a donation .	Would like to see the orphanage first in order to gain entrance to the building .	but
He 'd be fine .	We stepped into the kitchen .	if
Then he left his thick cloth sandals at the rice-paper door .	Stepped onto the rattan matting .	and
So i give in , pushing aside what i want just as i always do with l .	I love her so much and want her to be happy .	because
Maureen slowly enveloped her daughter in a firm embrace .	Making sure she had heard .	after
The country had flattened out and the trail improved .	He spurred the horse into a gallop .	so
I want you to feel free to say no .	This could really be dangerous .	because
How good-looking he was , or how electric it had felt .	He 'd taken her hand or held her to keep her from falling .	when
All her systems were functioning at optimum .	She could go from zero to one thousand in seconds at the mere sight of him .	if
Such a good steward of it , it was easy to forget that he was , without question , the most powerful warden breathing .	He was always so careful with his power .	because
She looked entirely serious for a minute .	Then she let a bubble of laughter slip out .	and
His hand was infinitely gentle , arousing her against her will .	It glided over her body .	as
Whose eyes i have looked into many times .	I spilled their guts .	as
Angling her lower body .	She could take him deeper .	so
Two days i make them .	You show up , and expect me to have some left , thats your loss .	when
I met their stares with a confrontational stare of my own .	I approached the emotionless faces of the assembled councilmen .	as
The days had become a continuous blur , held motionless in the mage 's spell .	She lay on the narrow cot .	as
She could crush his larynx in a heartbeat alex felt something , just a slight fluttering in her abdomen .	Rip his throat from his body .	but
Harry had meant to call on his cell .	He 'd been too busy getting away from joey and dealing with dexter 's preoccupation with erectile dysfunction .	but
Asking the cashier guy .	He 'll come screw me in the bathroom .	if
The gas to be stored .	You are intending to fill the ship with cargo .	if
Valerian had always been inclined to despise the other members of his sex .	It was overwhelming to encounter another man who could handle his like a child .	and
She had helped me to create something of beauty .	It satisfied an urge in me so deep-set and vital that i had never really realized what it was .	and
Any normal person would obey him .	He sounded scary , not to mention he had a gun .	because
He had covered his eyes with an arm .	It did not dim the brightness .	but
Hell , she 'd willingly accept the disease .	It meant saving them .	if
The crowd hears momma 's cough .	Sees her crimson stained handkerchief .	and
She had a smirk on her face .	She approached the bed .	as
Amanda beyer started to lung .	Then the nurse , mercifully , returned .	but
You can get all this information as one single block of thought in a one second download .	You have a clear connection to your higher self .	when
Oh , that had been the original plan .	What they 'd done was just mean .	but
Listening to the world outside .	I tried to fall .	as
The guys loaded the suitcases into the back of a shiny black range rover .	Liz and victoria got comfortable in the plush leather interior .	while
Dabbing soft kisses on her face .	Then he carried her upstairs .	and
His eyes locked on her mouth-and he might as well have been kissing her .	Her lips had to part so she could grab enough oxygen .	when
And she once had a shoe salesman bring out all the shoes in her size .	She thought he was mean .	because
He had remembered that budgetary constraints had forced the library to begin closing on wednesday evenings .	Pulling into the deserted runesburg library parking lot .	after
Said , `` '' .	What 's going on .	so
She certainly is strong and fiery .	That does not mean that these past few months havent shaken her world .	but
I feel when she 's at my side .	I 'm attending a funeral .	though
A spat of distant gunfire erupted .	He could pull the trigger .	before
Winston would never feel the same way about her .	She ordered the destruction of the mermaids .	if
We can check where you are .	Only do so as a precaution .	but
She placed the sheet over the pictures .	Walking to the bed .	before
Sam - '' i started .	He was gone then i was moving .	but
The horse 's gait jarred him with each leap of his great legs .	Reynaud no longer cared .	but
Standing close to the fire , roasting marshmal ows , was perry , the shape-shifter .	With him were two other guys and a girl .	and
Carl had no intention of harming pete , or anyone else unless it became absolutely necessary .	He still held the gun against peters back as they made their way to the centre of town .	but
I 'd rather wait until i 'm further along . '' .	We tell the others .	before
There were plenty of places i could crash .	I needed somewhere to go .	if
How mom and dad had raised such a jock .	Christopher and i were anything but .	when
After four and a half centuries , she 'd been sexually active for a long time .	She 'd found the urge to communicate on such a base level waning this last century .	but
I knew you went by that .	Our relationship has always been on more of a professional level .	but
`` you look your age .	Yet you do n't . .	and
I literally just had to hang there and do nothing .	Hope she was safe .	but
I can see nothing .	We will both make a search .	but
Or , sure . '' .	You know that sex will soon be involved .	when
He read more of the e-mail , afraid to skim it .	There was nothing of significance until he came to the final paragraph .	though
How much more could they have done .	They 'd had more help .	if
He 'd felt the same way this morning .	Witnessing jaime joking around with dominic .	after
I appreciate the thought . '' .	I have that covered .	but
He had a family -- parents , siblings , a wife and a child .	The containment teams brought him to our ship .	before
I could not see his face .	I knew he was only a few feet in front of me .	though
A few slow miles in , theres a sign , a little self serve place , and .	We hurry to set ourselves up in the last of the dusk before darkness comes on .	but
Claudia , lexie 's right hand , asked .	She joined her at her table in starbucks for their weekly meeting .	as
It was he 's going to get done to him what i did to the mad snake priests of start ! ' .	This time i 'll use both thumbs .	and
Elaine is on to something ; i just had to get her to spill it .	She says something like that .	when
He gets some of them off .	They 're always guilty .	but
Rolling large stones around the shore of the pond .	Leaving only a narrow pathway .	and
Her grandfather had died not much more than a year .	He was old , ill , in pain .	but
Malek was a master of capturing things with a few strokes .	Ruba is painstakingly detailed .	but
As we work our way through almost an hour of thick mid-city traffic , i 'm tense with wanting to get her somewhere safe .	A part of me is also glad for every minute spent without her knowing who i really am .	but
But david just shrugged .	Made `` let it go '' faces at drake behind kelsey 's head .	and
Someone came to the house .	Rang the bell only a few minutes after the sun set .	and
On the other hand then he owes me for saving you .	I bring you to peter .	if
Like colin , sean was tall lean , and .	He had short , ruddy hair framing an oval face and bright blue eyes .	and
The man is heavy .	I 'm having trouble holding him .	and
Josh , i love your enthusiasm , and i love listening to your heartfelt views .	We have to be realistic .	but
The princess will be forced to watch , for the rest of her life , this hateful creature have what she , the royal princess , can .	So it is her behind the right door .	if
Who hung out at the draft resistance center .	They too found it to be the only place where they could rap down the war , smoke dope , crank out high-decibel jimi hendrix all day without being judged criminal , crazy , or rude .	because
He opened the shoulder bag and spread the contents on the kitchen table .	He had got home the morning after the attack on lundagatan .	when
And get him some new clothes . '' .	You 're at it .	while
But today jokertown and surrounding neighborhoods would be chaos .	The jokers took to the streets and thousands of tourists flowed into the city for the parades , street fairs , fireworks , and other celebrations that marked wild card day .	as
She was charged with theft of controlled drugs , which she distributed for non-identifying alliance credits .	The charges there have been dropped against her since so much time has passed .	although
He searched for the words .	All he found in his brain were fireworks and an old road runner cartoon i am speaking the spanish .	but
Sprayberry , a burr-headed youngster in on the joke , only shook his head .	A yankee auto mechanic raised a hood on a car and shouted to his cohort , hey .	as
She was to him .	Her james was attached to her and so did not really notice any evidence to contradict this .	as
The keep the citadel .	It was a recreation of the first human-belovore building to exist in sondranos .	as
In all our times out , i 'd seen nothing .	I developed a persistent stomachache , my gut churning unpleasantly every morning at the thought of another day searching .	but
His soul for immortality , he knew what he would choose .	He had the choice to make .	if
Dogs and cows and goats were bigger than average .	Some of the birds we saw were enormous .	but
After a night of partying , they needed their beauty sleep .	I wasnt going to allow it .	but
To get out of classes .	You could get out .	so
Herself standing beside liam .	Dardan strode up to them .	and
Derek padded out of the green gloom , silent and stealthy on velvet feet .	Looked at me with wolf eyes from a human face .	and
Kat looked that way .	She found me with stephanie .	when
I stood there with my hand over my mouth .	I dropped to my knees .	as
There was no escape from the arms that imprisoned her .	Just there was no escape from morgan creek .	as
I would have felt weird .	It were someone i knew .	if
Yeah i feel like i 'm seeing double for a moment .	Both of them are leaning over me in the morning .	if
She 'd been doing so well the past couple of months she doubted they were anything serious .	There were moments when she worried .	but
Taylor took a swipe at aaron .	Jayden stepped in and blocked it so that taylor took a swipe at jayden this time .	but
I 'll speak to him myself . '' .	I get a chance .	when
They scrunched up their little faces .	They were furious at the world for keeping them hungry or wet or sleepy .	when
I knew bs agent julianne was probably trying to spin this around to the best of her abilities .	The fact of the matter was that b had made a royal ass out of herself and for that i felt really sad .	but
He made a face .	Wondering what kind of code that was .	as
I 've dealt with his stubborn butt many times .	I can be just as cranky as he can .	and
I was a clown to women .	I was first getting to know them .	when
But , even a short time after midnight might be too late .	The darklings were going to do something to rex .	if
If they 'd been in etruria , there would have been more ceremony to go through .	Rome still took a certain touchy pride in its brusqueness .	but
I was glad for her .	Winced at the power that must have required .	but
I see a likely spot .	We approach the town docks .	as
He would have held my hand .	He knew nobody was watching .	if
Made most of the turn .	The burning had started and so his car , idling , had driven into a brick mailbox .	before
Trying to make light of the situation .	I 'm totally freaked out-for a man to do something like that-is very serious .	because
He was cut short as someone thudded into him , driving his breath out in a short burst .	He turned , opening his mouth .	as
He smiled against her shoulder .	He brushed a callused hand over her skin .	as
`` make so much as a whimper , '' i hissed .	I will slit your throat .	and
They are distant , unseeing .	His eyes are set on me .	though
True to his word , tiberius had tied up the two guards .	They had dropped their weapons .	when
I was as shocked .	Everyone else is going to be .	as
We sighed in relief as the doors closed .	Gasped in shock when we saw our own reflections in the mirrored doors .	but
I barely touch the handle .	It slides inches toward me .	and
To walk in , in the oven , or on the counters scared her .	The shutters were coming down and have nothing on the stove .	as
Id rather be here talking with you and the other patients .	Yes everyone was dressed very nice and they were very generous .	but
Joan hated to leave aquila in the hands of hired help .	At least it was the leader , the blond from the camp with the long plait down his back , who came over to take care of her steed .	but
They were two vastly different species .	Andarions and humans were close enough genetically to procreate .	while
Winnebago came staggering out of the bathroom .	The bus lifted off .	as
Blowing in through the windows and doors like jets of translucent vapor before becoming stronger , more visible .	Spinning around her head like swirls of steam .	and
Him yehoyada , severe faced .	Do you believe in god .	still
Suddenly theres blaring music from the side of the room .	Everyone turns to see wayne climbing up onto a table while ac/dc blares from a small cd player next to him .	and
Im going to feeding centre two , he said .	Panicked , but with determined intent .	still
He pushed her back on the couch and she was his first meal in months .	Kissed her as though he were a starving man .	and
Nobody else does , and now its stuck .	I suppose i started it to get under his skinteasing him a bit .	but
They 'd called themselves servius ' slingers .	Now they were the sons of the slave , proud of their mongrel accents , their patchwork uniforms , their poverty .	but
It was potent and often didnt allow for despair or despondency .	It was not ashwins primary ambience .	though
He 's infatuated with you .	He saw you hugging me .	because
Jaime would have died two dozen deaths .	They had been fighting in earnest .	if
To slow down his kisses .	They grew more demanding and hungry .	as
And it was still torture .	Even my emotions were gone .	though
She was almost finished .	He returned to the cabin .	when
I saw the image in my mind .	I felt scared to even describe it .	and
His open eyes were filled with terror , and gazed upwards , as if still staring at something .	His mother found him .	when
He found himself covered head to toe in a bunch of gunk that probably gives a person cancer just by looking at it , let alone touching it .	He emerged from his birthing canal .	as
We could be sipping cocktails about .	You 'd taken that money .	if
Verity raised herself on one elbow to free the thin fabric .	She could maneuver the gown over her head there was a sharp , rending sound .	but
Where , that grew spaced .	Thered only been the lonely half-dead ghosts of trees , or acres of those dried-up , natural orchards of thin saplings .	before
A small landing was at its end .	A large golden door stood in their path .	and
To give it meaning , i mixed it back and forth before dividing it equally and sifting it around the base of each unlit candle with the same words .	Muttering a few words of latin over it .	after
He should shove her .	Forget how good it felt to be held .	and
Granby was still in the service , of course .	So their interests might not be perfectly aligned .	and
To take a calming breath .	Heading toward algebra ii with my pass from nurse tavers .	before
Nate sat down on the couch next to her .	Almost exactly he 'd positioned himself a few hours ago with sue .	as
To where the steppeman pointed .	There she saw a warrior propped against the rock face to her left .	and
I could at least take a shower and work out some of my pent-up frustration on my own .	Dovie wanted to continue to be a good little schoolgirl .	if
Now and i memorize the perfect shape .	Imagining her lips brushing against mine .	while
Was out of the car .	The motor sound had faded .	before
But , dorsey was reasonably certain that straight-shot 's intentions toward edie were anything but honorable .	Even he 'd never made a pass at the other bartender .	if
I felt coldness from beside me .	Looked down at perry , who was looking straight at ambrosia with a worried look in her eyes , her lips pressed into a thin line .	and
You 'd pass without looking over my shoulder .	We have work due in .	when
They could rip the kingship from king ine .	Establish a new king who would declare war on mercia .	and
Saying walter and judith , to herself .	Clinging to the most important of her memories .	as
First off , the woman is not dead .	Jennie 's dramatics imply .	as
In here it mingled with the newly polished wood and the faint smell of baking , and .	Helped create a welcoming atmosphere .	but
She had left this in the room .	I was in greyson 's office with brandon and katie .	when
We would walk around the city .	She shopped or ran errands .	as
* harold meanwhile had swung the unfortunate man around in a deadly military type manoeuvre .	He could retain a vice like grip on him .	so
He 's made every argument in your favor .	It comes down to the simple fact that father 's do things for their little girls .	but
He got along very well with his brotherand sister .	He was growing up and at the present time .	as
Asked in a distracted voice .	His eyes darted to the rugged metal stairs next to them .	as
Well there must be some other reason since baba and pa owned two business enterprises , both of which seem to be doing fine .	Robbie and earl james had good incomes .	and
I 'd hate to see such a pretty girl heartbroken . '' .	Her boyfriend had to spend time in prison for his violent tendencies .	because
`` yeah , hes a real f**king hero , '' ty grumbled as he walked out of the office .	Zane could hear the undertone of pride in his voice .	but
We 'll be there in a sec . '' .	You can sniff her and make sure she 's not a threat .	so
Now was a great time .	She had any prayer requests .	if
She already had a pint in her from the last tavern .	Thought that was perhaps why she felt so anxious .	and
The priestess squatted behind the altar gulped the contents .	Broke the seal on the white-stoppered vial .	and
The young man fell off .	Was being left behind .	and
We can follow his progress .	A player is on-line .	when
They 're sinking through quicksand .	My mind grows increasingly fuzzy .	while
They would respond only later when it was all over .	That was how things worked in derry .	because
She 'd marked the paths they 'd taken on the way in .	As she entered the tree-covered slopes , she mostly relied on the position of the cloud-veiled sun to navigate .	but
You might have more speed and strength than a moroi or a human .	You are nothing , nothing , compared to a strigoi .	but
He rested against the hummer with his bag at his feet he watched antonio until he looked his way , giving him a half-nod of appreciation for the information he so desperately wanted before turning to listen to whatever ezra was saying to him .	Face back to blank in elder zeller fashion .	but
He removed his fingers settled between her thighs .	Pulled her knickers off .	and
She sought her eyes for confirmation .	The doctor briefly met her gaze and looked .	but
Her docking bays and fighter bays opened .	Ships streamed out , evacuating the lost ship there would not be the time for many of her crew .	and
Every so often , the thought of leaving for new york would flit across my mind .	I would firmly push it .	but
Brimming with the moist saltiness .	It threatened to fall .	as
Reflexively , he licks his lips .	Realizes she means his piercing .	and
Which made the sky look but gave her both sunlight and privacy .	A thunderstorm were forming .	though
Handle and moved higher .	Isaac paid out the rope .	as
Slamming the rotting face into the ground among the tentacles .	Even his fist pushed through the mass of writhing parasites to get at the heart .	as
It can be read , except when it was right to do .	Should not be spoken out .	but
Only later did robert remember .	Realise what it had meant .	and
He nodded , but seemed reluctant to pull me into his arms .	Settled himself next to me once more .	and
He insists on sneaking back to the dorm with me for lunch .	Kurt hears that josh is in my bedroom .	when
Then she 'd let it go .	She really wanted to move on with me .	if
Just you thought you had it under control .	All you did was mess it up .	but
The matched armchairs are quite valuable .	So are the lives of the people who will drown if the ship sinks .	but
In case you have forgotten , he continued coldly , i am the costume expert in this opera house , and .	I have been for twenty-six years .	but
Hundreds of rats were drowned in the deluge .	Many humans and fliers were caught .	and
We have exactly thirty minutes . '' .	We have to be at the doctor 's office .	before
Her body still reacted her clit began to throb in time with her overactive pulse .	She knew it was an act , but .	and

And , the red enameled surface covered with a thousand dings and scratches , she stopped fighting the urge to ritualize the task and just let it happen .	She bolted armor plating back onto the frame .	while
The ceremony marcus had organised a bar and buffet for everyone , and i was definitely seeing stars from all the flashes that accompanied the obligatory photographs .	As i circulated , my right arm gradually felt as if it was going to be ripped from my shoulder from all the hand-shaking .	and
What he was looking for .	Knowing therewould be something .	but
I saw the queens men-at-arms announce our arrival at the door .	They were refused entry .	and
It 's not pleasant to think of lila as some vampire 's midnight snack .	Even she 's not exactly my type .	though
But she was a good fighter if pushed into a corner .	She carried a palm-sized pocketknife close by her in case of emergencies .	and
I brought up both my knees and kicked out , slamming him in the ribs and momentarily knocking the wind out of him .	He even settled his weight to pin me .	before
Jace caught her wrists , lacing his fingers through hers .	Drew her hands up to his face .	and
Wishing fiercely that his brother daemon was there to offer advice , he left the study .	Headed toward the bedroom that would be a very personal kind of battleground .	and
He would want a full sexual joining while he fed .	That was probably wrong .	and
Some killers keep mementos of their crimes .	They can relive them .	so
The crow responded , i dont know , my lady , but i have seen many battles in my days .	He surely fought with a true heart .	and
Keeping their jaws out of range .	A wide sweep could take out half a dozen small deadlings if they were unfortunate enough to get .	and

He 'd intended his words to reassure her .	They had the opposite effect .	but
Im not sure if youve noticed , but this aint exactly the cleanest transport in the galaxy , he mumbled .	He gently applied the spray-on skin to her cheek and neck .	as
It 's . '' .	I 'm absolutely exhausted .	because
The sense of emptiness abruptly vanished .	The world once again coalesced around him .	as
His wife had diabetes .	Was undergoing dialysis for kidney failure .	and
That will be my pleasure , '' .	Flashed me a grin that was nothing more than a baring of her pearly whites .	and
A knock on the door leading to the courtroom startled kiran .	He once again took a defensive pose in front of me .	and
You 're going to have to deal with josh .	You take the job .	if
Starving , poor thing , well well eat then you can catch some rest yourself .	You must be exhausted as well as .	and
There was a man sitting in the room .	He was hard to make out in the gloom .	but
Who had dropped in .	She did from time to time .	as
I relate to those instead of the people who are right in front of me .	I find what i believe to be better versions of them .	when
Which brought up the subject of what he intended to do with me the next day .	I had my own ideas .	because
The general finally looked up from his paperwork .	Asked stryker if he had found all the paperwork in order .	and
Venus has no water at all .	It is too hot .	because
The oldest were planted by the ents to try and please the entwives .	They looked at them and smiled and said that they knew where whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing .	but
She took a nervous drag on the smoke , but she did not look at him .	Noticed hank was watching her .	and
Was wiping the mud from his face .	He heard a voice shouting `` stop .	when
I might not have known it . '' .	I always did love him .	but

The navy needed a way to communicate with their submarines underwater .	They built a big elf antenna in wisconsin to send these long waves .	so
She licked her dry , cracked lips tilted her head .	Brushed a strand of damp hair back from her face .	and
She could go back to her manse .	Resume the life shed been living .	and
It would slide right out .	She needed the knife .	if
I feel myself cringe .	I try not to show it .	but
There were more carvings with the blue lines intersecting through .	Just he had suspected .	as

Where would you expect the treasure to be secreted .	You were on the ground before a tall building .	if
I 'd worn brand name anything , much less designer clothes .	At work , i wore my worn , secondhand jeans and shirts .	but
I could turn it up .	Then ze guitar would be too loud .	but
Lucy thanked the viscountess .	She took the empty seat beside her and waited for the attending maid to bring her a cup of tea .	as
`` though , '' she went , `` you 've given me an idea .	His eyes cut to her .	when
Itd make things worse .	I acted all maidenly around him .	if
That was exactly what the little girl was doing .	There was no way for her to hear joyah .	and
Go away , he added .	He made a very intricate series of gestures .	as
Her bun was baking .	Her bloody heart was breaking .	but
Would not cry a single tear .	The entire planet somehow got sucked into leveman 's vortex ( which was ominously visible from almost every angle of the planet .	if
Peasants to drink kvas .	Engage in wanton behavior .	and
The aliases set up by xops were impenetrable .	Even they found something .	if
Who was arrested not once twice , and .	Both cases had been dismissed .	but
There was still that .	Now it was mixed with other stuff .	but
It was in front of my face all this time .	I couldnt see it .	but
The lid of the thing flew off , and it was still an impressive catch .	Dark soda and ice went flying in every direction .	but

The thermal gel around their bodies had not only cushioned their fall .	It was now helping their bodies retain what little heat they had left .	but

I managed to pass .	So we got my picture taken and waited for my license , my uncle let me drive back to the ranch .	after
These were nice men , and i wanted to be sure it wasnt me .	They were going to talk some poor soul to death .	but

That , his motion would be less than fluid .	He did not have the knee .	because
He called to me .	I left the room .	as
He thought it was cute .	He knew she didnt like it .	but
It will fly by for you .	I dont have a job or anything .	but
In which he was traveling .	Saw that it appeared to be dry , passable land and it looked like a beautiful morning .	and
No one believed him .	He had lied about everything else in his political career including his promise to close it down .	because
Your father lied to you .	You have a girlfriend .	and
She would shrivel and die a little inside .	He should ever speak to her in so disparaging a tone .	if
The volume such that listeners in the back of the club would get walloped with sound .	The front of the crowd was merely tickled .	while
He was as calm and that impressed me .	I 'd ever seen him .	as
A cord had been struck .	He guided ernest into the rear of the bus to enjoy his feast without interruption .	as
Caleb was the threat she 'd known upon coming in .	The other one was now standing in front of her , touching her far too much for her liking .	but
One saturday she was unusually quiet .	She ate dinner with us .	as

To shoot one of the horses .	The truck broke two of it 's legs .	after
Through a window he could see most of the orsi troops ' backs .	They watched , and even occasionally applauded , caterina 's performance .	as
The insane man has not lost his ability to speak his language or dress himself or even accomplish some tasks .	His focus has shifted .	but
It would be safer .	This really were good-bye .	if
Maybe they did her mother and her a favor .	They had killed dennis .	if
Saliss hands flashed in the silent , subtle language only trained keyholders were taught .	They reached keyholder rank .	when
`` , before i bleed to death , '' he thought .	Only the field medics find me .	if
It happens in the promised twinkling of an eye .	Without last trumpets or angelic choirs and shes still corruptible .	but
No one would see him .	He chose to come to her at night .	if
Bhlokw 's shaggy brow furrowed .	He struggled his way through that .	as
Ben lightly laughed , staring straight up at the ceiling .	Laid down on his pillow .	and
For the rest of the day i kept my eye on that diary , sitting so innocently at the edge of the stair .	They hauled loads to the dumpster and shifted broken furniture and swept .	as
She 'd reflexively clutched the covers to her chin rather than simply something else for him to strip .	They offered some protection .	as
She had enough words .	Yet she was done khal drogo spoke a few brusque sentences in dothraki .	when
She expected him to put a game in .	He dumped it back in the pile , got up off the couch , and padded up the stairs .	but
More at stake here than just their relationshipas .	That werent bad enoughjosh was in serious danger .	if
Inside of me just climbed its way to the surface .	I swallow and force it back down into the pit of my stomach which has been trembling for the past few seconds all on its own .	but
Sweat pour down her body .	She undulated against the sheets , desperate for release .	as
Which she wore , and the sun was hot on her skin .	Getting deliveries ready to go in the mornings .	when
The line moved behind her and i instinctively moved forward with it .	She did n't . .	but
Jumping back a half-step with practiced speed .	Spinning on a dime .	and
It hit one of the men full on .	Even he was still seated high in his saddle .	though
Her body had a will of its own , seriously responding with little charges of electric excitement running riot .	Her mind furiously resented his assumption that she would share this desire .	while
But , why had he imagined that it changed direction .	He had imagined the meteor .	if
They 'd all met their women in less-than-ideal situations .	They 'd fallen hard and fast , and donovan envied their connection to their wives .	but
She was frazzled from all the running and the stairs and the panic .	At least they had a brief moment to pause and breathe and prepare themselves for what came next .	but
It would probably force the workers to go on strike-and if you try to force them back to work you will find they do not know how to control the machinery , so that breakdowns will begin to take place much more frequently .

As usual , i was seriously awesome at the conversation .	It was all in my head .	when
His parents couldnt hug his wounds .	Even they were there .	if
`` and marty bregman asked chloe . '' .	She turned him down , of course .	but
They pulled up to the motel .	All the lights were .	but
Held a mask over the girl 's face .	Several nurses monitored the flashing screens .	while
His face was grayish in color .	Mottled with weird patches .	and
I 'll show you around the offices .	You 'll follow me .	if
He was already living in a future at uw or wsu , which were even farther , and maybe that future included seth somehow , - seth was .	Maybe future really did have a place for the two of them .	but
Allie was on her way out of town .	She spotted grace montgomery -- grace archer since the wedding -- at the stand she occasionally ran in front of what used to be evonne walker 's house on the corner of main street and apple blossom .	when
And they would be my enemies .	I woke , if i lived .	when
Returning it to his pocket .	They continued on their way .	before
Under other circumstances , he might have looked like an ordinary guy .	Fangs distorted his face and his eyes glowed red in the firelight .	but
Slowly royce stiffened as if he were unsure of her and her love .	Anticipating a body blow .	though
From the drivers side of the cherokee , gabriel watched .	Former classmates came and went .	as

The dark spaces between and behind the homes held little more light than a limestone cave , particularly on cloudy nights .	The moon waned down to nothing , or hid itself .	when
The two men eyed each other warily for a moment .	At a look from daisy , alex stuck out his hand .	then

Jace was at first overwhelmed , having only ever faced the grizzled old guardsman in feigned combat , his current opponent was far younger , quicker , and felt it his duty to teach this upstart boy his place .	Years of practice and a natural talent quickly overcame his hesitation and it was the older lad who learned a lesson that day : that age or lack thereof did not necessarily signify ones level of experience or skill .	but

Donnie was never that good at math .	Wants his brother to have many doors that are flung open wide , wide , wide .	but
The wind flicked his hair about .	Had the moment not been so somber , his ridiculous attempts to quell the movement would have been laughable .	and
`` that smells disgusting , '' i said .	The onion smell wafted across the room to my bed .	as
One i find myself wishing for .	Will covet , above all others , that of your husband .	and
This was apparently a gathering place .	This city was a happier place .	when
He managed to catch both himself and her without either of them hitting the ground .	She ended up in his arms .	but
Before she could moan her disappointment , he was kissing licking his way down her neck .	His lips left hers , but .	and
His suspicions were right .	Twig was still hanging around to see how things turned out .	and
The tall gunman continued his strut .	He began a new tactic .	but
Alan was doomed to see and to remember all his life what he saw .	He would remember the night 's brighter marvels : the paper snake that became momentarily real , the paper flowers that had turned into a bouquet of light and a reservoir of power .	as

Moving nearer to the glass , his can almost forgotten , he peered through .	Tried to see into the girls room .	and
There was no movement to be seen .	The hobbits crept by cautiously , keeping as much as they could to the thorn-brakes that grew thickly at this point along both sides of the old water-course .	but
Uh ... i 'd appreciate it .	We change the subject .	if
A minor elemental spirit , the jeweling was merely a spontaneous manifestation of the powerful aura of the heartstone .	Possessed little more intelligence than a common animal .	and
He wore the same black body armor and expressionless white mask as the other strangers .	He was almost three times their size .	but

Vasily mutters a curse and stares in the rearview mirror .	Another gunshot rings out .	as
I sank down onto the couch .	Stared at the floor .	and
She had meant to walk right up to him and ask him a few pointed questions , but she could n't . .	She reached the doorway .	when
Something made her turn .	Just aria was backing out of the tiny curtained-off area .	as

Leo had dropped in on dans training session and began training .	He was spending more nights away on business .	when
But , he turned back to look at the clock perched upon the bank .	Stepping off that first block .	before
But she looked back at the trail .	Wondered if she dared to urge eb to move faster .	and
Quite a few people had thought mildred loeffler was cross and crotchety .	A few more had feared her .	and
She didnt look like a whore .	Respectable women simply didnt appear alone at yogwans .	but

The reaction kellan and the guys got .	They busted through the doors .	when
Wanting to look so different she would take rafe 's breath .	Saturday evening came anya dressed .	when
`` well , now we both know it , '' .	She giggled some more and , despite myself , i giggled .	and
She went through the automatic responses , reaching for the glasses and drawing the draft .	Her interest remained centered on farool 's continuing line , which seemed to fascinate her .	but

Pain washed over him .	He stood up and turned away from the broken window .	as
Then she smiles walks over to me with a thick black bathrobe .	Maybe she 's trying to figure out what to say the same as i am , but .	and

I was thrown off the bedroll .	Rammed against the glass wall as the dragonaut shook , twisting away from the explosion that was still visible in the darkness outside my wall .	and
She had not missed the blue mottlings on my neck and palms that indicated mushroom addiction .	I had inadvertently kicked the habit in the aftermath of my attempt .	although
He had dark hair .	His was streaked with gray and was a bit longer than holt 's , hanging down to brush against the collar of his shirt .	but
Never felt so alone as she did at that moment .	Yet the birds sang and the sun still shone on the golden aspens whispering in the crisp mountain breeze .	still
Both of them were damp with sweat and everywhere ty 's skin touched zane 's seemed to be on fire .	Even the room was chilly .	though
Ill be joining you there .	I finish up things .	after
There 'll be no terms .	Barbados goes down fighting .	if
Endelle turned back to alison , whose gaze dipped down to endelle 's chest .	The two couples vanished .	when
At the conclusion judge mroczkowski asked the witness a few questions .	Thanked her for attending the hearing .	and
I asked him about the dinner he was attending .	All he would say is that it was a routine business meeting for dionysus .	but
A hint of remorse flickered in her teary eyes .	She stood in silence .	as
But that will change . '' .	You will be cured of your ignorance .	and
My heart explodes with a sensual desire and i throw myself at him trying to wrap my arms around him to pull him closer , throwing him off balance and we topple onto the couch .	He reaches the nape of my neck .	as
Then there 's a good chance backman and hubbard tried to sell their product to the saudis .	The israelis kill him .	if
The days had shortened .	It seemed to him that he was always cold lately and when he wasnt lying in bed .	but
Her eyes gleamed with curiosity .	She rose up on one elbow .	as
You 're on your own .	It comes to ned .	when
He 'd looked like a haggard man of thirty , a month short of his sixteenth birthday .	He 'd opened his eyes .	when
I continue to round to the other side .	Then the hand rapidly pulls out of my sight as someone scurries farther behind it .	but
But she pulled up .	Acheron appeared beside him .	as
Work marked not so much by heroics .	Doing grim deeds that needed doing .	as
They were strange frightening , and .	We never sought them out .	and
His eyes were bright .	He seemed almost on the verge of laughing out .	and
She debated for a second .	Then tossed the purse back into the apartment .	and
It gave him an odd feeling .	He might be invisible .	though
She looked around to my parents and sister .	She grabbed my hand .	as
Over the past seventy-two hours he might have felt like the whole world had gone topsy-turvy .	That had been a mere taster for what had been about to come .	but
I will let you know .	I know that we have the support of our american allies .	when
Matt had a smart-aleck grin on his face .	Gretchen gave them an abbreviated version , leaving out the part about the footrace .	as
It had entered the monster 's mouth .	Jammed in its gullet before it realized what it was doing .	and
He studied his head .	The captain locked gazes with him .	as
She took care of me like i was her own daughter .	She loved you so much , like she was a truly grandmother to you .	and
None of jenny 's friends had much sympathy for them .	This ... nobody deserved this .	but
Saetan , this still , was like those winds .	He was this calm .	when
Almost a minute went .	Charlie finally answered my question .	before
Then he 'd struggled to build his investigative and personal protection business in sunny southern california .	He simply could not tolerate the idea of going back to cold weather .	because
My father would be with the strength of a twenty-year-old and the sturdiness only maturity imparted .	He were still alive .	if
Whitney briggs university is billed as a cosmopolitan educational institution tucked in the blue mountains of north carolina , and .	He died , both my brother and i set our scholastic compass in that direction .	after
Ian said , pretending not to believe her .	She worried maybe her mercedes , designer clothes , and fear of the water hadnt given him the impression that she was capable of being silly .	but
No she kept repeating to herself .	She scrambled through the leafs .	as
Okay , so finding him fresh from her shower wrapped in her favorite pottery barn towel was more awkward than intimate .	He was essentially a good guy who was looking out for them .	but
Carsforth saw the message on the back of the envelope .	Quickly tore it open .	and
Wearing bathing suits and flower-dabbed rubber swim caps , smoking and drinking .	The men drank martinis by the barbecue .	as
To drive them back into the darkbridge .	Burn their home-world to dust .	and
Sitting off to the left of the stage with this old guy in a fedora .	Then i thought hanging out with me probably wasnt his first choice either .	but
His eyes had a haunted look , but he 'd had to do it for survival .	He spoke about what he 'd done .	as
`` it 's hardly matronly , '' she said .	Cameron laid the diamonds across her bosom and snapped the catch .	as
Why you 're both .	Why you blasted the kitchen .	and
I could feel their eyes on me .	I took in the regular supplies of food , wine and fuel .	as
I barely knew the man .	The last i remembered , he 'd been working his way up through the pure-blood politics .	but
Crawled out the window .	Just the basement door creaked open .	as
Then i will meet him .	He can tell me what happened to my dad .	if
It may sound grueling or impossible .	I have never felt more content .	but
Ian rubbed my back .	I tried not to cry .	as
For one teeny little moment , i felt a pang of jealousy .	My mother comforted the motherless child .	as
Hope he 's on our side .	He can do things that i 've never even heard of .	because
Ben had called several times , suggesting they go to dinner and talk .	She had been putting him off .	but
I couldnt kill him .	It came to it .	when
Maybe , kira shrugged .	She stared out over the veranda at the city .	as
Then theres nothing you need to concern yourself with him .	He isnt willing to come out and say whats on his mind .	if
It would be impractical to land there , and impossible to take off from .	Even he could force balkind to fly lower .	if
James was a single father .	Ivys mother hadnt been in the picture since ivy was about six months old .	and
He 'd given bubba a magazine to look at and a bottle of life support to sip on .	Began to poke around behind the bar .	and
I gasped , and stopped moving .	I wanted more than ever to move after hearing his words .	though
Tommy waved the microphone/toothbrush away as if the memories were too painful to recall .	Actually he was trying to remember jody 's last name .	but
I send out one fleeting hope that he and the children will always feel my life force surrounding them , then my world becomes silent and black .	My heart beats slow and my conscious takes it final dip before descending into the darkened abyss .	as
Enough , boyo , finn said .	He shot him twice in the chest .	as
Touch the sensitive spot below her left ear with my thumb .	My lips hover over her neck .	while
Youll know its me .	This is the music youll hear .	as
`` you told me .	I was young that the voice in my heart was that of god .	when
As i was putting the gifts that she had gotten out for penny , i was smiling , and i wasnt crying .	I had a few tears .	but
Laxus began to pull .	Froze when he saw what taruss shadow looked like .	but
It was easier to say .	He wasnt gazing at her with those intense dark eyes of his .	when
Caleb drew his swords .	Twisted them around his body in a beautiful and flawless display of power and skill .	and
Lucan steepled his fingers again , `` as you well know , i have served his majesty for just as long as you and-and i , too , like you , have served his father . '' .	He had done earlier in the curia when he stood before the emperor .	as
To be wearing armor .	Carrying knapsacks and blanket rolls and shields .	and
Your feet making fart noises in your boots .	You walk around the whole day and you get a hat and you go up the maas and they take out an m-16 and you go aft to the fantail and figure out how to shoot it .	so
I wonder . '' .	He watched over us from his window .	if
`` yes , it is an emergency code only . '' .	We can go in .	but
How to create fire .	Hold it in my hands .	and
Your tongue must be hung in the middle .	It can run on both ends .	so
To let out his next growling snore , i reached down and put my lips against his .	He opened his mouth .	while
There 's a light breeze that carries a few hushed whispers from the campers ' tents my way .	Everything seems to be in order .	but
Vincenzo bundled her onto his lap .	Alonzo maneuvered smoothly into the traffic .	as
Hard , to say it was the reason i resented cora was a lie .	I tried to deny it .	as
A clever one , for this weapon was a sa'angreal not for just the one power for the true power .	It was a trap , and .	but
`` considering how she stopped that forklift with kinetic energy she would have done so already . '' .	Evalle was going to attack anyone .	if
Alright im on my way , she said .	She grabbed her jacket from off her bed and ran down the stairs .	as
It was hot in the room .	The coldness wouldnt leave her .	but
Carmine nervously ran his hand through his hair .	He sat down , remaining quiet as the priest settled into his chair .	as
It was hard to ignore the echoes of the old feelings and memories in my heart .	Even i knew that what i felt for owen was much , much deeper and that he was far more important to me than donovan had ever been .	though
Why try to blow us up .	Waylon was the only intended target .	if
With heavy hearts they all got to their feet .	Followed braulor into the cave once more .	and
Hunter was going on in his smooth voice , '' or . '' .	Maybe you still have some loyalty to thewitches .	but
It would be admitting to myself that i was corrupted .	I visited a shrink .	if
But the movers and shakers were busy bullshitting and sizing each other .	Their guards all eyed each other .	while
She was glad-so very glad-that he was well that she opened her lips beneath his and wrapped her arms as tightly as she could around his neck .	Even he 'd just been awful to her .	if
It was the day , but arranging a meeting with him was intensely problematic .	Thanksgiving and armstrong was in self-imposed exile from public affairs .	after
You 're fidgety and restless . '' .	You 're turned on but have to wait on me to give it to you .	when
`` , we will have to withdraw and recover in the world of dreams '' .	We are wounded in dire ways .	if
I have two magic bombs .	My sword is hidden in my jacket .	and
He was a total innocent .	She had been meeting ari .	before
That had been folded into thirds .	Sealed with a few drops of black wax , called in his half-moon glasses .	and
And i thought my heart stopped .	My name was finally called .	when
Cab 's eyes narrowed .	He took in another couple ; hannah ashton and cody frank .	as
I will not hide like a mouse . '' .	I could be helping .	when
`` you undoubtedly have many questions , '' he leaned closer , `` and i am a little short on time at the moment .	I will do my best to answer .	but
I may have passed a few tests .	Someone had shot at me that day .	but
I hope you did a lot of core work .	That 's where the f**king comes from .	because
His knees went weak , but from pleasure .	She took him as far as she could .	when
That 's not quite true .	Hey , it 'll work .	but
All the rest were perfecting their blows weak sides .	The majority of the crowd was leaving .	while
Seldon and palver spun around ; a band of attackers was upon them .	It was too late .	but
It would be a long haul the first year .	The final price was well within their reach and their financing would cover nearly two years of renovations , if it took that long .	although
He died . '' .	He got in too deep .	because
Zips up his jacket .	Snowflakes stick to his brown hair .	as
I wouldnt be able to kill them all .	Even i had my gun .	if
She grabbed a bottle of wine then mixed in some herbs .	Poured some into a chalice .	and
It was over for her , dropping her against one of the coffers on the far side of the aisle .	She was muttering something and the jaws of the beast flew open .	but
I am lea , rosa as much as lea .	For in my heart i am lea as much as i am rosa .	and
What would you have done ? '' .	The first time the breh-hedden struck , you found that the woman you needed to be with , to protect , had been abducted by a madman .	if
The mind has been negatively programmed .	Even we could realize .	before
You held me in your arms .	I told you i was glad you were home .	and
From inside , the guitars played .	Voices were raised in a fresh eddy of laughter .	and
In fact , it would please him .	Any woman of at least above average beauty revolted against modern fashion and decided to wear giant loose fitting dresses .	if
To keep the cattle in the corrals over night .	They had to get all the dna scans done before nightfall .	so
Well i can decide .	This is an amateurish mistake or a brilliant move .	if
By the time she was ready to leave she 'd exhausted ryder with her talk .	She 'd also become a fast friend .	but
This seemed to soothe walter .	He winked back , running over to join the others in front of the fire .	and
We have searched all .	Can not find him .	but
... you are paralyzed ... to make a decision one way or another ... '' a decision about what .	You would only assert yourself .	if
I pull one out .	Turn the barrel for inspection .	and
Not only how weakened she was passing out .	She was talking to the floor .	but
I 'd seen them in the mirror .	I 'd used the bathroom .	when
I could hear the deep fatigue in his voice .	A big hand rose slowly out from under the quilts to touch her cheek .	but
She needed to rest .	There was no time .	but
Then into them i should go .	I perform well only in real-life circumstances .	if
Celia 's cheerfulness was exhausting .	Link found he was too tired to argue .	but
He settled in the pleather seat .	Set his papers down and sighed .	and
They have been deceiving you for centuries , turning into stone .	Your true leaders have been locked away starved .	while
It might kill martin .	The immari did n't . .	if
'' rhys said , `` . '' .	They were strong enough to bring us to the treaty table and force a peace that more than half of every race of the fey thought was unfair .	but
Worried eyes shoot towards andrew .	Jeff braces himself for an angry response which i know will not come .	as
Quickly she held the flame .	It was divided in two by the plastic strap .	so
Tatiana said they had withdrawn from the human realm a long time .	She talked like us .	but
He thought , the panic starting to rise in his chest .	He pulled against the strong hand , trying to force his body away from it and failing as more hands began to emerge .	as
I catch her eyes and wiggle my eyebrow once , signaling to her that i win round one .	She finally looks up .	when
It had sat up .	Explained that it was an igor and in very good shape for an igor , at that .	and
That would be great , i responded .	We passed the road sign that said 17 miles to air force academy .	as
Flailing his arms , like he 's trying to break dance and disco at the same time .	He shuffles his feet .	as
Kairos 's upper lip trembled .	His eyes were fixed on nakita 's .	but
The two parties met .	For a moment , it was nothing but a voluble swarm of half-sized bodies all jumping , pulling and shoving for the doctors attention .	and
He was on her .	She even had a chance to move .	before
`` holding on and letting go '' by ross copperman came through the speakers and i almost turned it off .	That would be admitting the song bothered me because it made me think of katie .	but
He 'd found the crystallized dragon , half-crushed but still an awesome discovery .	He 'd never sensed this pulsating energy .	but
`` , then you will rip up this contract , and you will remain mine . '' .	You want your brother .	if
Chelsea took the first step .	Garrett gripped her shoulder gently , stopping her .	but
I made a stealthy retreat to an adjacent staircase in the home .	Freddy and the guests dutifully surrounded bartell darcy .	while
She gets a pink tutu .	We shower her with petals as she pirouettes about the place , spinning round and round until she gets wobbly and falls over .	and
He pulled her around .	They faced each other .	so
She was upon anton within a moment , toppling him over and opening her mouth to bite .	Lina knocked her from on top of him .	but
The pair turned to each other , and shook hands and smiled .	They did on that day when they first met four years earlier .	as
One girl has the really bad judgment to slap me in the back as i go by .	I have to stop for a moment and give her a lesson in manners .	so
It may form the basis of an interesting discussion over what may cause such a difference .	It would never be used for cruel taunts .	but
To return to the camp of the old people for another winter of pampering .	Nothing better turned up .	if
If she 'd been killed ... jamie 's hands tore away from her hips .	Just his claws burst from his fingertips .	as
He began crying in earnest .	The hunter spotted the warriors .	when
Rowdy and shit went .	First one was about family .	but
She taught me to feed him insects and bugs .	Showed me how to gather leaves for his nest .	and
She wanted to make sure we could get in on it as soon as possible . '' .	My mother heard the news of your find .	when
Minnow and i were the type who could grant itbut i already said that i cant because magic isnt realwhat would it be .	You had one wish .	if
My eyes shut and shake the thoughts from my head .	She flits around the back seat claiming everything .	as
He might hurt them .	They completed their tasks .	before
Confusion furrowed her brow .	Her eyes widened and she clapped .	before
Then simply leave it .	It 's time to go .	when
She raised an eyebrow at him in challenge .	He only quirked his own back at her .	but
Should you lose your title , the engraving will remain .	It will cease to pulsate .	but
He jumped the turnstiles in one leap .	Shot a single bullet into the corner .	and
Dropped a small coin into the offering box .	She lighted the wick of a candle on the front row .	before
Bummer , i wanted to do that for a while .	It looked like ogana beat me to the mark .	but
I take a breath .	Push the math book .	and
It is . '' .	It got up and walked .	if
`` both wrong , '' cried bilbo very much relieved .	He jumped at once to his feet , put his back to the nearest wall , and held out his little sword .	and
They 'd see the light , this time for good .	She used her charm to escape .	when
Centralized systems amplify such events .	That is why they are so unstable .	and
Hoping to console her , and she could not be consoled .	She felt banished from the light that was within them .	but
They were as exposed as if it had been high noon on the sunniest day of the year .	A patrol were to walk past .	if
The world had been twisted into a rubbery pretzel around me , smelling dust and mold .	When i opened my eyes , i was lying facedown on industrial looped carpet .	and
I caught him picked him up , the red wave of energy coming out of my whole body .	He moved to run , but .	and
Without waiting for him , she turned and , sliding in the gravel in her terry-cloth flip-flops .	Headed toward the gate .	and
I tried to keep my voice calm and logical .	I was simply trying to hash out a problem with a friend.it .	though
So i put it aside on the floor beside the desk .	I got down to homework for the night .	while
Bertholdier paused , his breathing steady and audible .	He spoke , rendering a command decision .	then
That was the moment my fourteen year old heart developed a crush on the guy sitting next to me .	Even i hated them both .	though
The moon was bright , and the night was warm .	The world was visible and colorless .	and
I dont know what they told him ; maybe this knife-throwing pal of theirs made a habit of getting into trouble .	They seemed pretty easy about it .	but
To confirm their direction .	One of them whispered to the other .	when
He handed me the keys told me to expect a drivers safety lesson this weekend .	Instructed me to drive .	and
Now you should hold on to them because one day they will leave too , and you will be left .	There are still people in your home who havent abandoned you .	if
Then so be it .	His survival meant he had to fight a little dirty .	if
He tucked the gun .	He sprinted to his car , fumbling with his keys and cursing as he got the door unlocked .	as
It was a good rifle .	Even through the growing mist and spitting rain it was a hard shot for a marksman like kendril to miss .	and
We 're gon na have to do that .	We got ta make concessions without harmin ' the end goal .	if
The field was relatively new .	Massively funded by an ever-decreasing but desperate segment of the old undead .	and
It did not rise .	It thrashed and spasmed for a while as we watched it .	though
Granted , i never asked for more .	Mainly i thought that because i was fair with them , they were fair with me .	because
He took his time he took his pleasure .	Their bodies trembled , but .	and
He snapped the top .	Sat back in his seat .	and
Ashe and oscar stuck with black .	Ginger continued to water his down with sugar and cream .	while
After all , you had no trouble with the other three .	What are the odds of finding three old vehicles that would be able to be started and driven .	and
Roger said into the phone .	She was out of range .	after
At his continued advance , her mind blanked .	She took a step back , rounding the bed .	and
He chewed the small insect with gusto , he liked the taste of grass-jumpers .	It was hardly a meal .	but
It would have registered on her monitor .	It came from outside .	if
He might never understand her reasons for resisting an engagement .	He took the easy way out for the sex he wanted .	if
They all had money on them .	They were loaded down with gold chains and bracelets .	and
The word `` comeback '' had not been used until that point .	In the past three months lucien had managed to drop every other possible hint that he wanted to become a lawyer .	but
With a deep sigh , she flopped down on him , chewed into him felt the sweet nectar of his life flow into her .	Placed her mouth on his throat .	and
When he sees a type of loneliness in someone else 's eyes .	Realizes he could be the one to take it .	and
In michelangelos depiction they were being separated from the damned , as our lord jesus christ , the judge , was casting the damned into hell .	All souls were rising from the dead in the lower left side of the mural .	as
Withering on the bed , i stuffed my hand into the pocket of my coat .	He blurred back to his dresser , managing to hit antonio 's number on speed dial .	when
* * * `` , i might be able to hit the woods for a few hours in the morning .	We get everything done today .	if
Stefan had kept it sharp .	It had probably been centuries since he 'd used it .	although
I straightened out my legs over his .	Let my head rest just to the side of his .	and
For several seconds he did nothing .	Stare , as if waiting for her to laugh and say , only joking .	but
I was about to voice my hopelessness .	A shadow stirred near the doorway .	when
It mounted the blazing stairs it removed something from the disintegrating remains of its clothing .	Held it carefully in its teeth .	and
Xander walks back over .	Hanging up the phone .	while
Officer hutton , return here , chan said .	You have escorted them out .	when
She looked forward , her hand slid from mine up to my forearm where she grasped it and pulled me closer even as we kept walking .	Suddenly her manner became urgent .	and
Once the rust cloud settled , jaikus moved to the doorway .	Extended his torch to the room beyond .	and
`` hurry up , slowpoke . '' .	Your brother makes you go home .	before
Julia 's passion , ignited by gabriel 's affection , poured into his mouth .	She endeavored to show him how much she felt for him .	as
To feed you to the lions .	You disagree with us .	if
He 'd always imagined that she 'd feel like this .	Imagining and knowing were such different things .	but
Kindly comply with their requests .	They assure us that once their business is concluded we will be allowed to be safely on our way .	and
Yeah , she 'd thought sourl like whuppin ' on the boys .	Fuckin ' the mammies .	and
Nobody troubled his head any more about him ; the school was removed to a different quarter of the hollow , and another pedagogue reigned in his stead .	He was a bachelor , and in nobody 's debt .	as
`` , maybe they 'll go away and not hurt anyone else ! '' .	They find what they 're looking for .	if
His smile was bad .	Throw in that voice and good god .	but
We opted to take the elevator to the third floor , where nicholas , quon , and i shared a room .	We got to the dorm building .	when
`` i frickin ' hate this , '' she said .	Ran a hand through her hair .	and
And , we will not retrieve our martis . '' .	You will not retrieve your valefar .	if
I sat in silence in the corner of this memory .	He lifted the dress to his face and sobbed into it with muffled cries .	as
To clean his face .	Four times he got on the bus .	before
She tried to push the grasping arms away from her .	She no longer had any dexterity .	but
She takes a while to say anything .	He watches her lace up her boots while she thinks .	so
That does not mean that the mortal is going to agree to come with me .	I choose a mortal for my purposes .	because
I notched the land rover up to a comfortable purring speed .	Frowned at the speedometer , which told me kilometers per hour instead of miles per hour .	and
I 'd never ridden in a mercedes before .	Wanted to explore the vehicle a little .	and
I slammed my elbow upward between his legs .	Ricky jumped the pipe .	as
People were still talking of it , before the first-footing .	We adjourned to the house , just before midnight , for stovies , beer , and cider .	when
A faint glow became visible around her father 's prone body .	Sally felt an answering heat begin to spread through her veins .	and
You count seventh grade or she 'd tell the whole school i was too scared to kiss her . '' .	Nicole locked us in kayla 's closet during a game of spin the bottle and forced me to touch her panties .	when
Jaime tried to halt .	Their spears prodded him on .	but
They 're older craftier and .	They 'll keep trying .	and
It made a loud splash .	It hit the black water .	when
You retort , seeing .	He blew up a building in the dark knight .	before
It was a stupid question .	Clearly , everything was n't . .	because
It happens to rain .	You 've already trapped it .	after
It was some bullshit reason of trying to protect me .	Everyone would be calling me and staking out my house .	because
Back as far . '' .	I remember my father thrashed me for the slightest thing .	as
That perhaps these plains existed only to slow down the dullards who crossed it .	To enable those with keen minds to accelerate their travels .	but
Everyone always thinks itll be a great idea .	Then the temperature drops , the snow hits , the island loses power and they pack their bags .	but
His name was on her lips .	She slid both of their hands over her sex .	as
The previous owner ran out of money before he renovated the top floor . '' .	That 's what i 'm doing .	so
She 's being truthful .	I can feel her quick pulse against my finger as i spin small circles under her tank top .	because
Not being as clean .	It used to be , or dinners being too little or too late , or the weight she had gained .	as
He zipped around the corner of the museum .	I could yell stop .	before
Lita slowly puffed on a cigarette .	She lapsed into deep thoughts that only she could distinguish .	as
You will have to learn a lot .	I can teach and guide you , for if you use your powers properly , you can gain control .	but
Brent was never able to sleep in .	His neighbors were loud and the walls were thin .	because
Grease , meat , pine resin for some reason , old food ... . ' .	I 'll swear no living thing 's been in here in the last day or so but him and us .	but
You know . '' .	I was a little kid my dad used to do this .	when
He shot her in the back .	She ran for the door .	as
Wayland stepped out behind him .	Harley reached the doors .	as
After easing her to the cot by the mirror , he found a blanket .	Pressed it to her wound .	and
Changing into bed clothes .	Sleep was the last thing he would be doing .	when
Ready to smash a coffee pot over his head .	He made the slightest move toward olive .	if
Arent you always , katelyn replied .	Refused to be bothered .	but
He at least wanted to see it coming .	This was the end .	if
When the boys had sat down in the car , the angel waved goodbye .	Disappeared out of sight .	and
Once there they never seem to do a lot apart from drink too much and indulge in a little mild corruption .	It takes years of effort and work and scheming for a god to get .	although
You are these days .	I 'm my father 's son .	but
My parents would probably have simultaneous heart attacks , imagining me in vegas .	I 'm sure that even my uptight dad could have gotten behind a $ 250,000 angel investment .	but
Unfortunately , the momentum was .	The grass tore out of the soft ground in jack 's hands .	and
He drank the rest of his water and the employee was swamped with people ordering more costly drinks .	Tried to flag down the bartender for a refill .	but
His stride was awkward , slow .	He was a pitiful sight to see .	and
I could come over in a couple of hours .	Youll be back by .	if
I know , hard to believe i 'm such a chicken .	At least i 'm still the director at least i hope i am especially now that charles is definitely gone .	but
He took another deep drag .	Handed the remainder back to parnell .	and
Mostly , i reported them for kingsley 's benefit .	I knew allison had internally followed my traveling , swooping mind .	as
They 'd pay one percent on whatever salary they take .	They 're a ceo of their own company .	if
The road made its way mostly along the northern side of the valley wall .	Then climbed to wind up the far end and then out .	and
That man is drowned .	The god has made me strong .	and
Pearl flew off quickly and merged with councillor shufflegrub .	Just he got out of his car .	as
She was not quite sure .	She was being complimented or mocked .	if
It-which are real jobs .	Only you happen to be married to a woman whose family owns a hundred and fifteen drug stores .	if

I had a proper sleep .	My eyes just closed down on their own .	and
It was purely a business decision .	I asked smith to become a permanent member .	when
Moaning the whole way .	Stopping as suddenly as it started .	before
During his break , the singer came over .	Sat down beside her to go over her instructions .	and

He could have ordered replacements .	He ate and drank anyway , wringing whatever little pleasure he could out of the meal .	but
Taking the withered , blackened organ with him .	He mowed down several clones .	as
It must be done each day .	It will take only a minute of your time .	but
When she saw what camilla was trying to do .	She crawled over to help as best she could but try as they might .	and
Crow placed the crystal back in his pocket .	They took a final look down the corridor then strode through the doors .	and
As for the basement ... it 's now an indoor pool .	You can see that .	but

And i told her we 're just friends .	She still wants to meet you and i promise you it 'll be cool .	but
When he tried to deepen it , i pulled away and .	Rolled onto my back .	but
A few large and beautiful trees had already been cut .	Lay dead in the thick brush .	and
When he stepped back from the table .	She could breathe more .	so
Kanade sat in a gigantic office chair with a desk between them and lightly traced runes .	Leaned forward , extending a dainty hand and pressed her soft finger to his forehead .	and
`` okay , '' she said .	Some great burden of decision was now resolved .	though
I decided to add the canadian element .	My nona used to tell me stories about how the canadian soldiers liberated limosano .	because

It was both intense and numbing .	His spine had been caught in a vise .	though
To talk or simply hold her .	She knew he was there for her .	so
To pick her up early .	Drive her to where she 'd take her sats .	and
In the end she tried a dozen gowns before she found one she liked .	She refused the crown that jhiqui offered her .	but
She made it to the door .	Just storm stepped up to it and he had to wait for her to grasp the handle and pull it open .	as
That was usually the case .	Especially the event happened to include anne marie-like dinner at her and robert 's house or a holiday get-together .	if
Patiently , i waited for his answer .	At the same time , i was desperate for it .	but

It was a massive area to cover .	He took his time and worked his way through it .	but
Lady aquitaine 's shrug a slight shake of her head adequately conveyed that she , too , had sensed something but did not know what it was .	Roaring wind made conversation problematic , but .	and
She pointed to tomika to take control of the performance from her post at the bottom of the steps .	She was adamant about keeping silent after noticing the expressions on her peers .	but
Then mari might have seen it .	His classmates saw it .	if
She enjoyed his touch , a fact that drove him crazy with desire .	He reminded himself he was a still a gentleman .	but

Her well-worn gray sweatshirt and khakis fluttered with the next gust .	Delicate fingers , not made for pulling triggers , swept hair out of her elfin face .	and
On the other hand , the majority of the new orleans mayfairs came equipped with umbrellas and raincoats .	They fully expected some sort of storm .	though
The machete threatened to strike .	Stopped as fast as it started .	but
Wheelan uncapped the bottle .	Handed it to me together with a tumbler filled with ice .	and
It 's possible her brothers can .	Azami can slip past our guards .	if
When my mission was accomplished , i gathered up my discarded clothes .	Brought them out with me , shoving my shoes ahead of me with my foot .	and
`` , '' i started , `` can we take off on your bike ? '' .	You deal with the russians .	after
None of us spoke .	We were too afraid of the tears that would follow .	because

It might feel that way .	He knew about the giant bears .	because
Artie peters , the newest member of the group , laughed .	Trailed off when no one joined in .	and
Armansky had contributed this information .	It was completely off the record .	but
It was a pretty building ... but .	Still a strange sight-it looked like a giant kid had stacked glass boxes on top of one another .	but
He stuck it out , and .	When they came to ' technical subjects ' he did better .	but

A lot of time had passed .	People were now trickling out of harry o 's .	and
Spilled over and ran a quick path to my chin .	Ceri 's eyes rose to mine , red and swimming .	when

His face remained sympathetic .	His tone betrayed his own rising temper .	but
Anger and desperation welled up .	In one quick turn , she threw the empty bottle across the room .	and
Stopping that spiral , she flicked the right-hand toggle upward , making sure there was nothing close behind her .	Looked to the screen on the dashboard .	and
Robert looked really proud of what eva had said .	Even she was also talking about his lack of finesse .	though
I 'd no sooner walked .	I saw ty attacking van with a can of cool whip .	when
Which got boggy in places .	It falls into gullies and rises up the hill .	as
You 're not an impulsive man . '' .	Many would say marrying a woman you 've known such a short time-and one you admit you 're still getting to know-is extremely impulsive .	but
Once a soul is entrusted to us .	We have distributed the agreed-upon power .	and
And , i 'm coming right after you because you 're the sweetest little guy i 've ever met .	I ever do turn gay .	if
There was already some considerable distance between the pig and i .	I had to get to it .	but

Grandfather had been a businessman more interested in profit .	He discovered that a few other families who were saddled with these dependents were also looking to shake off their humanitarian roots and acquire some serious wealth-the kind of wealth that could have an impact on the world .	and
I realized i was laying on top of samson .	My mind pushed past the screaming of my nerves .	when
The apprentice sat up in his dark corner by the fire .	Smiled a smug smile .	and
I mean those who are ny born .	They were used to look down from the fiftieth floor .	as
About giving it a few strokes across a toilet seat .	Giving it to her .	before
She said she had gotten sick .	She was chewing her sandwich .	as
Some of the family went to watch the game , others went to the kitchen to help store the mountains of leftovers .	The meal was cleared .	after
We will go and test the theory tomorrow .	I said earlier if you two feel happy to do .	as
Theyre complaining about my behaviour in class .	Are blaming saffy and jaz for being a bad influence .	and
Wiping at her face .	Smoothing her damp hands on her soft flight pants .	and
R-17 beamed codes to the device .	The doors swung open .	and
While i sincerely do not appreciate any comparison of myself to an overly large , wild beast , i 'll forgive you . '' .	I 'm quite certain you 're not yourself with everything that you 've undergone .	as
That didnt mean he wouldnt hear something that she actually wanted him to hear , did it .	Just he insisted he couldnt read her mind .	because
She never once looked .	The temptation corded the muscles in her neck .	though
He may be a stanford , and i control him . ' .	Maybe i was only a waitress .	but
Lucien walked to the seating area .	Cosmo pushed away from his desk and approached from the other side .	as
I keep my focus on his hands .	They tend to my abrasions .	as
Kicking it into the corner .	It missed and landed on the floor in a soggy heap .	when
We hid it for about a month .	Social services got wind .	before
He and his female companions were obviously taken aback , but the man , after introducing himself as doctor kindlebergen , explained that they were returning to munich to resume his prewar practice .	Colling addressed his question in their native language .	when
She glanced down at the desk .	Drew a fingertip across the spot where his hand had been .	and
Matthew had thought that dardy looked bad enough passed out .	He looked much worse now that he was .	but
He crossed the lounge and stopped .	Lifted his hand to knock on her bedroom door .	but
Durnik 's recent elevation to disciplehood had changed him in some ways .	Had not lessened his appetite for his favorite pastime .	but
One of the ships looked in amazingly good shape .	The other had landed .	while
It comes with the willingness and determination to move on no matter what lay .	Revenge dies and hope returns .	when
The voluminous robe closed .	She left the massage room .	as
She had chocolate , and she 'd tried to be satisfied with that .	Even she 'd always had a sense of it not being .	though
Kayla do you promise not to tell mom and dad ? '' .	I let you do something .	if
When the last echo had died away , the septon lowered his crystal .	Made a hasty departure .	and
He wants a change .	He 'll miss his best friend .	though
At his parties his speech and gestures became exaggerated and .	He and his guests seemed to vie with each other to see who could behave the most .	but
... '' `` well , what did you think would happen , mom .	I 'd known how it would all turn out .	if
I patted my friend on his shoulder and his legs were hanging out of the frame of the door .	Walked over towards the door to see that hopper was lying on his back inside the place .	but
We were both drunk that night .	My brother was eighteen years old .	but
We 'll have time for one book . '' .	Then we can wrassle your jammies on .	if
The gears spinning in his head .	I entered holding molly 's hand and guiding her blind steps .	as
So you can give me rotten and unidentified food to consume . '' .	You balk at my walking faster than a turtle .	but
Both of their bodies bounced around on the bench seat .	He pulled out onto the pavement .	as
And gotten so ripped .	The hell had torin .	when
It took quite a while for caleb to make it to the end of the hallway .	When he did he found himself in a large room with benches lining the walls and large glass windows on the front side , letting a plentiful amount of sunlight fill the room .	but
She was standing in front of him .	He opened his eyes .	before
Theres a long pause , and the scientists study the formula .	The members look at each other , waiting for some insight .	as
Why did reading his words stir feelings inside of me that i thought had been buried .	Not speaking to or seeing him for months .	after
I went to slip on my tennis shoes .	Stopped when lana gave me the stink eye and held up a pair of low-heeled strappy sandals in the same sky blue as my blouse .	but
She sensed a melting pot of reaction from mr. ingram .	It was as uncomplicated as a homemade soup .	but
`` forgive me , your majesty , '' tindwyl said , `` . '' .	Statement seems somewhat naive to me .	but
They covered it and the leather handle with dirt and you couldnt even tell the room was .	The lift up door was closed .	when
That was his right in the sanctity of his own mind surely it was not his place to make it so obvious .	Obviously he didnt like her , and .	but
`` and , '' the mayor says , `` they obviously keep getting in , too . '' .	They keep getting out .	if
His legs were moving just fine as he crouched holding his gun .	Naomi went over to check and he snapped at her .	but
Suddenly recalling the horribly tense scene .	Just tara had left the palm beach house and cole had come to the conservatory to eliminate any distress she 'd caused .	after
They heard a knock on the rear side passenger window .	They were pulling out of the parallel parking slot .	as
There would almost certainly have been blood sprayed all over it .	Someone had opened his throat .	if
He drew back for another blow , and landed with all four feet against tiger man 's side .	Something streamed across the room with terrible swiftness .	but
Had left but thanked him .	Turning back on the prophet .	before
Then there were the voices .	Sounds that kept waking him .	and
The officer repeated it .	He were writing it down .	though
He picked up his gun , they dashed out of the room , along the corridor and down the stairs .	Then grabbed tanias hand .	and
You have no problems with the military .	You go to the border .	if
Pird pressed a catch under the hose 's reel .	Immediately the hose thickened with rushing water .	and
It sent chills up the back of his spine .	Those words left the captain 's mouth .	when
Alex rounded the corner of the building .	Walked up to the tavern .	and
There she looked at various clothing and fabric stalls , finally finding the right one .	Walking down the covered market way .	while
I gripped his shoulders , as it sent him over .	My body shook with it .	as
Agatha flicked on her flashlight .	We made it back to the entrance of the hangar .	when
Skylar must have been leaning toward the `` hysterical '' interpretation .	She wound up and smacked her , right across the face .	because
He was an integral part of the local resistance .	Had his hands in a lot of things .	and
Even i didnt do anything wrong .	What i get in trouble for something .	if
Peter sighted the spokesman .	Josh panned the group .	while
Her grandmother 's lips were moving .	Only the faintest of sounds came out .	but
Gabriel walked straight past him .	Headed for the stairs .	and
Yup , we get along .	Probably we 're so different and rarely compete for the same stuff .	because
I 'm a gentleman . '' .	There 's nothing about seducing an unconscious vampire that appeals to me .	and
The plane climbed into the sky .	Turned south ivan closed his eyes and tried to reason his way through his next steps .	and
Theyd go to visit the sprites for a while .	Never stayed past sunset .	but
And , it was because he was holding on to the edge of his own control .	He sounded less than thrilled .	if
It 's having you as my husband for eternity , '' she said .	She lifted her head and looked deep into his eyes .	as
The men at the cutting table laughed .	They always had when flores sashayed away , and , looked at gabril to see if he was any cause to be leery .	as
I slapped his shoulder .	He stood beside me .	as
Sure enough , as i came around the corner of the building i saw him there , just standing .	Staring at the ground .	and
The moment she stood next to him , he opened his arms she pressed herself against him , her arms around his waist .	He meant to lay her out on the couch in a different way , but .	and
Hed lifted my hand to his lips and placed a light kiss there , never breaking eye contact .	I could take a breath .	before
Then i do not know how much more i could possibly hurt to satisfy your desire for vengeance , daughter . '' .	That is not the hell you wish for me .	if
Emma braced for a lecture .	Instead , he just looked sad .	but
When she heard his message she had to clear her mind to everything .	The person she wanted to communicate with , then send the answer in a form of meditative thought .	but
His proposal had taken blistov about twenty-five minutes .	During which time he managed to eat an entire chateaubriand and drink his share of the wine .	also
The needle poked through his flesh .	There was no pain .	but
Kai turned , and yelped .	Marched out toward the cargo bay .	and
Call me . '' .	There 's anything you need .	if
Dad would skin me alive .	I did something stupid like that .	if
All been playing together for fun for about six months .	We got our first real gig at a local restaurant .	before
The hideous beast had seized the mans shaking form , sucking the energy from his body .	Viciously ripping a chunk from his throat .	and
`` i think your other friend wants to come with us , '' he commented .	Wondered if the girl would understand .	and
I 'm sure that we could create a creature with wings and a level of intelligence that no bird-thing will ever have .	We really want to .	if
Genya gave a little bow .	Laid her hand on my arm to lead me .	and
Which is like my wall in my bedroom on planet earth .	Bodies swish by and settle around the noble round table .	as
Bella might not be a welcome addition to the scene at this late juncture .	They would have to accept her presence .	but
To meet paige 's sisters .	They flew home wednesday night .	before
He spied her flick her hand in his direction .	He charged after her .	as
She made for home thereafter and then east again along the firths to find vermund , and said that the whole matter would be thrown over unless he became leader .	Told him what things had come to .	and
`` that 's . '' .	Younger ones have to step over them .	when
Seems , so there was a bit of a grudge .	Boone stayed over for a week without paying .	as
Where i was preparing supper .	Talking with uncle beldin .	and
Hooded figure coming down them towards his building .	He could spot any black cloaked .	if
After dinner , the group returned to their routine tasks .	Bri showed najima around the group 's small compound .	while
She holds half his soul .	He 's feeling the same as she is .	and
It was her mother 's swear word when things were really bad .	Seemed appropriate for the moment .	and
Even hastingss swollen eye opened wide .	He stared in bafflement at the warlord .	as
She rolled him over , onto his back , then scooted closer so that she could use him for a pillow .	She could stop herself .	before
Tomasz 's lips move .	He tries to figure out that sentence .	as
Then make a pitiful whine .	She curled up in the kitchen in the spot where his high chair stood .	before
But who would you be .	You did not undertake such a journey .	if
You would drown in distance and multitude .	Sight were to run rampant , and constantly dwell on the size of the night sky .	if
I wonder . '' .	You might marry me .	if
He caught the young one on the back of the head with his practice weapon .	Doing a front flip over lov .	while
There would be no escape for anyone .	This secret were discovered .	if
My rational mind knows that this is highly unlikely .	It is giving us something to do besides panic .	but
His face turned a shade of ashen grey and he paused .	Aldo unwrapped it and the contents came into view .	as
I detached a jump toward the table with the intention to give him a beautiful zampata .	He moved him fast as a lightning and it jumped me in rump , later it extracted immediately the claws .	but
He pulled off his gloves and unbuttoned the middle two buttons of his red wool jacket .	He could pull the bottom of the red cotton sweatshirt out of his pants .	so
She unlocked the window .	Squatted behind the desk .	and
Well , that 's not exactly the way we say it .	I guess it 's .	but
We turned into the great hall .	I saw the cause of it .	and
Every single one of them put their fisted hands over their hearts .	Bowed slightly in my direction .	and
She saw his hands clutching the steering wheel with such intensity that his knuckles were white .	Julie craned her head over the seat .	as
The other man took a bite of his donut .	Continuing to look at her in fascination .	while
In all truth and honesty , 88 would feel lonely .	They were to go .	if
He withered away until there was nothing left but his bones .	They had soaked up so much of that amber dye that they became the same color as the hills .	and
Walter cleared his throat .	Set her head down on the rooftop .	and
Spent twenty minutes flying lazy figure eights over duttons golf course and soccer fields .	Winging her way to the village .	before
He made the gesture look smooth practiced .	To my knowledge he 'd never handled a fading knife of any sort , but .	and
Belle let out a strangled scream , pulled her to his body and dragged her back several wide steps .	Just jack 's arm hooked around her waist .	as
Suspected it 'd be sexy watching you pumping iron .	I had no idea it 'd make me so wet .	but
He called for espinosa .	Ordered him to arm half a dozen men and go ashore to investigate .	and
We ended up going down to his room .	Katie was taking a nap .	because
She twirled a strand of hair around her finger .	Rubbed the soles of her slipper-clad feet up against a wood pillar .	and
To explain all those books you had to read to me .	Poor mr denker is half blind .	because
Streaks of green and black paint remained on his cheeks .	Most of it had washed .	but
She found the redhead facing off with kane , who stood in front of her with his arms tightly crossed over his massive chest .	She reached abby 's door .	when
Him hanging around near arnth 's house earlier .	No one believed him .	though
I am open to that possibility , ryan answers .	He looks toward the ice-covered window .	as
A new name was definitely needed .	It was time i put my immense brainpower into thinking of one .	and
She could handle all the energy flooding her brain , all the emotions and the bombardment of sound assaulting her .	She was close to him .	when
I knew what they were really asking .	Ethan didnt seem to care or maybe he didnt notice .	but
The wolf got to its feet .	Started stalking back and forth inside the thicket of trees .	and
They went around the rocky base of mount shrak .	Tlantar was startled by how many outlanders and tonthakan deer hunters were encamped on the broad plain stretching out from the foot of dahlaine 's home .	and
He turned on his heel .	Strode forward , entering his closet and disappearing from view .	and
Twitch closed the door .	Peering out into the hall .	after
'' langdon said , `` .	`` as you probably know despite galileo 's compromise , dialogo was seen as heretical , and the vatican placed him under house arrest . '' .	still
They 'd flipped a couple of tables in the common room .	Were creating a cross fire , permitting other people to escape .	and
He 'd been wearing .	I 'd returned to the apartment .	when
Reached for his hand .	At the last second , i pulled .	but
Maybe i am losing my mind .	As i have thought many times here , i may have lost it long .	and
Often hurled in heated discussion .	Debating with christian feminists .	when
I repeat on a hush , `` it 's just not that easy . '' .	He shakes his head in confusion .	when
Resting his arm on the mantel .	Turned away from mesaana .	still
Eventually mony came out .	Told the lemmings to go back home for lunch .	and
Blood trickled from his neck .	Swirled down his chest like a tiny , winding river .	and
We drove home saying nothing .	She took my hand again as we walked up to our house and led me to the kitchen .	but
When she brushed her hand lightly against his cock , he jerked away from her and .	Grabbed her wrist to keep her from stroking him .	but
A mother can love her daughter .	Even she 's been sinning like it 's going out of style .	if
No question that a single power is more efficient than divided powers but the traditions of the papacy were around long .	Our modern democratic governments came into existence .	before
I say , and i bid them goodbye .	Well you are sure .	if
I showered , moving .	Pulled on my work clothes .	and
`` if you try to kill me in my sleep , i will come back as a ghost and . '' .	Make your life a living hell .	but
Two bravo team members stood over their cache with alarmed looks on their faces as though they feared overrun from the opposite direction .	The first sight of the supply station set up for bravo team came into view .	when
Breaking into a full sprint .	We headed for an abandoned shelter .	as
No way-what ! '' .	He sat on me .	if
Francesco , jsus called out .	He scanned their ids beneath a flashlight .	as
But all that was for nothing . '' .	You 're standing before me now saying that you feel nothing for me .	because
He slides into a seductive grin .	He pulls me in by the waist .	as
Nerves skittered around my belly .	I sprinted up the ramp .	as
You to get soaked .	Mom is coming to get me .	when
Spark an actual conflict .	Sampsons intention was only intimidation .	if
Herding sheep . '' .	You can believe that .	if
Furious at their head was the king , fear holding a vice-like grip on my heart .	I glanced at kaspar .	and
I can see caleb standing .	I look to my side .	when
Hed been with the company for almost a year .	Peter had never taken much notice of him beyond the standard superficially friendly office greetings .	but
Yicle regained his seat , caffeine addicted ( occasionally only water addicted ) centurions .	Having pandered to the ravenous .	and
She moaned deep into his mouth .	Her tongue danced a dance he had never forgotten .	while
Creating the sense of fleeting movements in the darkness .	Something lurked just out of sight .	though
The commissariat requisitioned most of it for the other regiments .	Captain evan and rob had been successful in obtaining militia ordnance .	although
We killed two taking them . '' .	A third is dying .	and
That will make it easier to get them free .	They go before them .	if
It 's too far alex to walk .	She 's still healing .	while
Although senior was shocked to find out what junior had done , he couldnt help .	Be proud of him .	but
He slid gently back in .	That definitely felt nice .	and
I just dont want you to go .	I shouldnt have used my masculine wiles on you .	but
Distract me . '' .	You want to help .	if
She saw fangs begin to grow in the girls face .	Deb fell back against the closed door to her living room .	as
He pulled from his spot .	The girl even reached her car .	before
I was still crying .	I 'd show them all .	but
Items had been moved .	The room looked tidy .	and
Showing its dental apparatus and cold eye above the surface of the milk .	Ensuring that taimi was still in her seat watching it .	as
There was an immense distance between the signaling executioner and the gallows , and the signal was obvious : the boy was dead .	Reginald was only partially visible .	but
Me do a search .	You bring a p.i .	before
She usually spoke without considering her words , responding with a simple , brutal honesty that always left him feeling as though the ground was cracking beneath his feet .	He kept his voice quiet and neutral when she was distracted with something .	if
She 'd just gotten out of the goose , in the employee parking lot at harvest meat packing .	A nondescript man had approached .	when
Melissa was both taller and heavier than her tiny husband .	She had the same shapeless cloud of thinning white hair he had .	but
To come up to little tall .	She could scream down at him from her bedroom window to be sure and hang those sheets with six pins , not four .	so
Damn , she thought to herself .	She made a conscious effort not to look .	as
I was paralyzed with fear .	Terrified of getting attacked .	and
The day was still young , with a damp fog covering the land , preventing the horses from kicking up dust .	It was still a little cold .	although
He was halfway down the tree .	His darned boots slipped again , causing him to skid .	when
The ancient mysteries would be lost for all time .	Their own brotherhood one day died off like its predecessors .	if
Something inside her had snapped and she 'd fought him off , grabbed her clothes , and fled .	He tried to consummate the act .	when
Determined to enjoy the time they had left , she slowly unbuttoned kevin 's shirt .	Pushing it off his shoulders .	before
As was his custom .	He was able to .	when
He always felt a twinge of fear .	She neared the staircase-it was wide and curving , and made of highly polished marble .	when
Wearing high heels or any feminine footwear .	Riding a motor scooter .	while
I might have conformed better than my sister . '' .	There are still things i do my own way .	but
Allahandras coach to arrive .	It only took five minutes .	and
Jo steeled herself for the blow about to come , wondering if she would make it to ernie 's father or die here in this room .	His hands balled into fists and one raised .	when
Eric shut off the computer , but his thoughts were still of his father .	Chris left the house .	when
I slip into the hall .	I toss and turn for a few hours .	after
It would not get any colder that year .	He was not going to get a coat .	because
He limped hurriedly toward the wagon .	Ehren waited until the last minute to haul the team to a stop .	and
I 'm counting on you to make this mission successful , ? '' .	You 're the leader of the five , right .	because
At least , that was .	He would show up to class and actually look at me .	when
He was knocked back about twenty feet .	He was ready for the blast this time and protected himself from the worst of the blast .	but
Jade waded in threw herself down on her towel .	Ran up the beach .	and
I thought he might laugh .	Instead , he said , `` think about it , mercer .	but
He could have transformed all these men at the same time .	Master han had succeeded .	if
He had , but making sure that his opinion of his brother was stamped across every word .	Throwing damon against the tree .	when
He trembled over me .	My insides tore apart at the seams .	while
The officer wasnt in the mood for a quarrel .	He seemed a bit happier seeing me in such a state .	though
Jade would 've happily beat his behind as soon as look at him .	He would have thanked her for it .	and
He pitched over the side .	Never struck the water .	but
Jade had snatched up the knife from mateo 's table .	She 'd just shoved the tip against the witch 's side .	and
He dreamed of what could have been , if only for the nerve that had eluded him .	He gazed upon angel .	as
Then he met my eyes . '' .	Said , `` i know just the place .	and
Luther 's shoulders slumped .	He tugged at his hair and made his way back toward the other bed .	as
I wonder . '' .	She went to wayne 's house .	if
Mr lee may have his faults .	He beat me fair and square .	but
She decided not to mention this to robert until she had more proof .	She rode back to the barn .	as
There would be no kindness in cass touch , the encompassing need for blood .	Only cold hard want .	and
Good call , richard said .	He selected them , one by one .	as
You should leave these with me .	You go to your mom 's this weekend .	while
Catching tane 's arm .	He surged toward hess .	as
He 'd closed his eyes .	She knew by the deep vee between his eyebrows that he was far from relaxed .	but
The skin prickled at his neck .	He spun around , nearly slipping on the wet leaf-litter to peer into the charged darkness behind him .	and
Dirt and ash bypassed my mask and filled my nostrils .	I was able to breathe .	when
Life doesnt have to have any form or even be visible to human eyes or known by ordinary means of observation .	Buddhists know for millennia .	as
No one else wanted to think of it that way .	Luther knew there were two greenwoods , just like there were two tulsas .	but
Her eyes drifted to his collarbone . '' .	She said quietly , `` i should have talked to you at chilton 's after i overheard your conversation on the phone .	before
His aunt had a visitor .	Wouldnt give the name .	but
Even it was spring .	The waterfowl were migrating .	and
If it were me , i would want some privacy .	Told of such a terrible loss .	when
It took all his self control to maintain his human form .	He reached the university .	when
He had several close calls , where the path gave way beneath him .	He was always able to crawl back out with only minor burns and injuries .	but
A shiver ran down his spine .	The scream echoed through the trees .	as
How each other got chosen and all the others are chosen at birth and that made me feel so bad .	Apparently there are few people like me in this college .	and
Seemingly oblivious to it .	She placed heaping plates of food before aria .	as
You should have asked me . '' .	I wanted my first kiss to be with a murderer .	if
In fact , sky was almost sure that none of them had seen this mission as different from anything else they had done until that night on the island of apathy when the blinding blue light had lit the clearing .	A legitimate hole had ripped open in the dark above .	and
Letting in some fresh air .	He rested , reassuring her .	while
He met pesh 's gaze .	He went to close it .	when
And , her left sleeve hanging loose as she had no arm , sasha knew shed found the right person .	She stood up and turned around .	when
There 's a very great deal she should be taught .	It would be absurd to think that in such a short time gwyneth can catch up with all the skills charlotte has acquired over many years , not to mention the ... er , unequal distribution of natural talents in this case .	but
Ronis heart thrilled when xander did not move away from her .	Instead put a comforting hand at the back of her head .	but
To pound like a bass drum in my ears .	I saw that there at the sides of her temples , were orange-yellow streaks of hair .	as
The marquee display on the coke machine flashed its internal temperature .	The promise of a cold drink was endorsement .	as
With a roll of her eyes she finally climbed in , then gave him an evil smile .	She threw the car into gear and pealed out of his driveway .	before
When my paperwork doubles .	Stays that way till they either settle down to country life or go back to their big cities .	and
She would want to keep seeing him .	His luck was holding .	if
Having the money to pay for this ship didnt seem to have much meaning .	He was the only one on board who was idle .	when
When he touched the keyboard , the screen saver disappeared and .	His eyes were captured by the words .	but
In areas with more brick buildings , a little normality could be seen .	There was no street that hadnt been damaged or was not littered with cars and rubble strewn all over the asphalt and sidewalks .	but
My heart is true .	I have not yet lost my way , for i remember what i still want out of life .	and
And let out a pained groan .	She lifts her body off me .	as
Then she trickled a few drops of the nail polish on the center of the page .	Said : reveal to us suzan 's family tree .	and
Sophie sat in a velvet upholstered throne , swallowing laughter and rubbing the silken fabric on the armrests .	They waited for the hostess .	as
But the pyramid of tsort had been quite clear about the rewards for whoever brought all right spells together at the right time .	Trymon was not about to let years of painstaking work go for nothing because some old fool had a bright idea .	and
To widen that room .	Be ready to lock it tight .	and
The black hole underneath him disappearing in a hiss .	He took a step .	as
I 'd never pressed for more information .	It came to him .	when
But i 'd heard the eagerness in his voice .	He confirmed the bass maltings venue .	as
To take several breaths .	My chest starts constricting .	as
She was sorry for not being there for me .	She would make it up to me every day from then on .	but
I should have better luck .	Practicing all day yesterday .	after
I know this sounds crazy . '' .	When i first found out , i actually considered terminating the pregnancy .	but
It had been put on the back burner .	The rest of the valley was sterilized .	while
After everything , we 're still as strong .	We were the first time around .	as
I wouldnt have tried so hard to get people to pay attention to their bill .	I had seen the note before the debate .	if
Marcus took that as his cue .	Briskly strode to the mouth of the tent .	and
To give someone your everything .	A part of you believes you 're their nothing .	when
After centuries of random wandering to and fro in the land , some of their number came at last into far northern thalesia .	Dispossessed the styrics and their gods .	and
Soon we have water and a basket of chips , and im dipping a warm tortilla chip into salsa .	I hear , ooh , if i knew it were you two , then i wouldve gone .	when
